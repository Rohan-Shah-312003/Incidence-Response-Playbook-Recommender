1. During routine monitoring, the SOC team observed repeated authentication attempts on a file server at approximately 12:30 AM, outside normal business hours. The attempts originated from a valid internal user account that is not authorized to access the server. Shortly after, several unusual log entries were generated indicating access to sensitive directories. No scheduled maintenance or automated jobs were planned at this time.

2. An employee reported receiving an urgent email late at night claiming to be from the IT department, requesting immediate password verification to avoid account suspension. The email contained a link redirecting to an external website resembling the corporate login portal. Shortly after the report, failed login attempts were observed on the employee’s account.

3. Automated alerts indicated outbound data transfers from a database server to an unfamiliar external IP address during early morning hours. The server is typically idle at this time. Initial review shows that the transfers were initiated using a service account with elevated privileges. No recent configuration changes were documented.

4. Unrecognized authentication attempts and sensitive file access were observed on an internal server after midnight using a valid employee account, with no scheduled activity planned.
