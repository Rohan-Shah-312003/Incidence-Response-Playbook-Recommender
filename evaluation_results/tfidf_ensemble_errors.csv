easterbrook cfa mseasterbrook dainrauscher com neal dingmann ndingmann dainrauscher com ene sb aggr market focused on liquidity crunch and unknown cash flow liquidity crisis we believe this market is assuming the most grim valuation for these off balance sheet partnerships and other investments that they have no residual value in addition enron cannot issue debt to fund the short term cash flow need as the company needs its investment grade debt rating for its wholesale segment management has discussed various asset sales that should benefit the cash flow situation million in the q and portland general in late but the market is unwilling to believe these asset sales will be timely shareholders have paniced as million shares were traded yesterday but we believe even with dire assumptions the stock can rebound from current levels once the liquidity situation clears up diversified energy group drawn in the market now is taking it out on other diversified energy stocks as they declined significantly yesterday we believe investors are worried about two factors that may impact the group if these companies extensively using the off balance sheet structure and if the natural gas power merchant business will be negatively impacted by the wounded enron which is the largest merchant player in north america if this continues to impact the group there could be an excellent buying opportunity at some point long term valuation we have included a net asset valuation on enron making several dire assumptions ol enron will be impacted to the full extent of the off balance sheet partnerships our assumption is billion the company writes down their investment in broadband our estimate million and their entire net investment in the dabhol power plant in india our estimate million valuing the three major business with the corresponding ebit multiple pipeline x wholesale x and retail energy services x we derive the ebit multiple on wholesale and retail using dynegy s nyse dyn sb avg current ebit multiple on our expected ebit which includes the share drop from yesterday although these ebit multiple seem to consistent with the current market trends they are well below historical norms for the group ol we have looked at the asset valuation in two ways first we have assumed no asset sales and used equity funding as a plug figure which dilutes shares outstanding by our worst case scenario without asset sales comes up with a net asset valuation of per share including additional shares issued at per share our second valuation assumes asset sales of billion assumed debt reduction of billion from the portland general sale and no equity financing with those assumptions we derived a valuation of per share of course our net asset valuation is based on a long term view and does not take into consideration the short term liquidity crunch ongoing at the company in addition we are making a fairly bold assumption in that all these partnerships and investments no longer have any residual value debt rating most important enron management will have to fend off any debt rating downgrades below investment grade so debt cannot make up the cash flow shortfall the company in our opinion will use assets sale and if necessary equity funding to match up cash flows in the short term unfortunately the timing of assets sales can be lumpy so equity funding is not out of the question panic mode abound with the rapid decline of the shares on large volume we believe investors are panicking and the shares are oversold at x our earnings expectations although the upcoming q and q probably will not paint a good picture we believe the company is in better shape than a per share stock price suggests with further disclosures on operating segments and on the off balance sheet partnerships we believe during the next few quarters we could see ene come back into our valuation stock opinion we believe that investors with a time frame of months should now look at enron shares due to our assessment of the company s attractive valuation there are obviously major concerns regarding enron s cash flow liquidity in the coming quarters but we believe management should be able to time the sale of assets and equity financing if necessary to bring the balance sheet back into order most importantly the company must keep its investment grade rating to keep its wholesale operations running smoothly we believe the core businesses should allow earnings growth of annually three year projection we are not suggesting that enron is out of the woods yet as investors should pay attention to several short term events first the filing of the third quarter q should enlighten the street on the equity reduction and the cash position of the company we also look for the sec to come down hard on these partnerships we anticipate further disclosures on these partnership going forward in addition we anticipate that the company may still have another write down and or further reductions of equity in the coming quarters our net asset valuation notwithstanding we keeping our price target using a discounted cash flow dcf analysis of the wholesale energy segments and ees segment in the more established energy segments we used a multiple valuation of x ebit we have changed our risk rating on enron corporation from average to aggressive to reflect our assessment of risks associated with the issues discussed in this note we rate ene shares strong buy aggressive company description enron corporation is the leading integrated natural gas and power

any questions you may have as always we appreciate the opportunity to be of service to you best regards jerrold graber michael matthews scott notowich sr vice pres investments st vice pres investments st vice pres investments financial consultant financial consultant financial consultant we thought you would be interested in seeing equity strategist view for the markets as we await the re opening of the u s equity markets it seems to be a good time to reflect on some of the fundamental and technical issues we will have to confront in the weeks ahead to say that the future is unclear is to state the obvious we must examine the information currently available make suppositions about the likelihood of future events and structure our portfolios in a way most likely to exploit short term market inefficiencies and take advantage of our long term strategic views to us there are at least five issues which will influence the course of the economy and markets in the time ahead the effects of global liquidity consumer confidence and energy prices should determine a great deal of the equity market s direction and internal dynamics in addition the fundamental and market performance of the technology and financial sectors should have an impact beyond their normal sphere of influence global liquidity we believe that the government will try to make individuals and institutions as whole as possible clearly washington does not want a financial panic to exacerbate the physical damage already done we believe that the federal reserve will effectively make unlimited liquidity available to the system as they have done during prior crises additionally the executive and legislative branches appear ready to provide fiscal assistance as needed we should assume that the government will behave rationally and apply the techniques used successfully in the past these actions would tend to be supportive to the markets while the european central bank has stated that no easing is imminent they obviously are ready to inject liquidity on an as needed basis consumer confidence clearly the consumer will be negatively impacted in the short run by recent events obviously air travel and lodging will feel an immediate impact however the key questions are how much will the consumer be effected and for how long we note that following the crash of wall street predicted a dramatic consumer slowdown which did not materialize we do not intend to draw direct analogies to but would merely point out that predictions of consumer collapse have proved to be unreliable while some slowdown will inevitably result from the catastrophe one must remain aware of the consumer s inherent resilience and the potential offset of the fiscal and monetary stimulus discussed above while we do not wish to minimize this potential problem we believe that it must be viewed in a broader historical context oil prices early indications are that responsible oil producing nations will not move to seriously curtail production or shipments while nothing can be ruled out it is hard to say that the perceived risk to world wide oil supplies will necessarily result in higher oil prices this is important the absence of a price spike would significantly differentiate today from the precedent then the risk of inflation affected the fed s ability to rapidly lower rates and offset the price rises in higher energy prices undoubtedly contributed to the subsequent recession and the fed s decision not to immediately cut rates adversely impacted the consumer we must indeed ask ourselves if the risk to the world s oil supplies is significantly greater today than it was a week ago technology and communication services surprisingly technology was one of the better performing areas in the european markets in the days immediately after the tragedy while one does not want to read too much into this a logical progression of events could help the group s fundamentals in the months ahead initially much of the infrastructure damage done will have to be undone after any disaster the first response is to replace or repair that which has been damaged this could provide a short term boost in spending longer term there will likely be a need for increased spending on bandwidth back up recovery systems storage and communications systems in recent months many corporations have deferred technology expenditures this week s events may accelerate the resumption of meaningful technology spending lending a much needed boost to the group financials financial services companies are obviously adversely affected by recent developments existing concerns have been heightened by these events insurers face the potential of massive claims banks and brokers face potential credit concerns and the impact of distracted capital markets however as mentioned earlier we anticipate that the fed will be injecting needed liquidity it would be rare indeed for financials to fare poorly while such an easing is underway a healthy financial system is essential to our country as well as the world investors while recognizing the damage done should also be aware of the potential benefits

exchange commission the amendment also contained a provision co sponsored by sen paul sarbanes d md that would preserve ferc s authority to require that energy rates are reasonable and do not include the pass through of holding company costs that are unrelated to energy another amendment offered by sen jon corzine d nj initiated a study by the general accounting office of the success of federal and state governments in preventing anticompetitive practices by public utility holding companies and in promoting competition and efficient energy markets institute s tax agreement with public power again introduced on hill the tax agreement eei reached with the american public power association appa and the large public power council lppc again has been introduced in the house the bill hr

been incorporated into s senate energy committee chairman frank murkowski s r ak energy security bill and stand alone legislation could also be introduced hearings are expected to be held in both the senate finance and house ways and means committees probably after consideration of president bush s individual tax proposal administration ferc white house seeks trillion budget in fiscal year president bush last week transmitted a trillion fiscal year budget request to capitol hill the administration noted that its proposal moderates recent explosive growth in discretionary spending to four percent in an increase of billion over the preceding fiscal year the budget bid contains a billion total surplus in and projects a trillion surplus over the next ten years in the energy area the administration noted the federal government s longstanding and evolving role in the sector pointing out that most federal energy programs and agencies have no state or private counterparts it proposed about billion in discretionary spending for energy programs and about billion in tax benefits mainly to encourage development of traditional and alternative energy sources doe s budget request was billion including billion for energy resources programs this later figure represents a decrease of million or percent from fiscal year in the environmental sector the administration sought some billion in discretionary funding for epa including a billion operating program focused on implementation of most federal pollution control laws success of restructuring tied to energy strategy ferc s massey asserts electric restructuring may be in jeopardy and its success is in the hands of regulators and policymakers ferc commissioner william massey has asserted speaking at a recent national governors association policy forum in philadelphia commissioner massey urged officials to pay attention to the key elements of a national energy strategy first he specified there is a need for an adequate supply of the energy commodity turning to a second element commissioner massey told forum attendees that all the supply in the world won t help unless it can be delivered over an adequate efficient non discriminatory network commissioner massey identified market structure as the third essential element of a national energy strategy while citing an inherent difficulty that good structure cannot be easily parsed between wholesale and retail jurisdictions accordingly he said ferc and the states must work together on market structure the final element of a successful energy strategy the commissioner specified is the need for aggressive ferc intervention when markets fail to do their job if the states cannot depend on the wholesale market regulator to ensure reasonable prices for consumers he cautioned they will surely think twice before heading down the restructuring path new generation dynegy to build second plant in kentucky dynegy has announced plans to

about whether aquila might have reduced its credit exposure to enron apache is a small customer in what for enron is a small business he added enron has been under pressure since october when management announced that the company had incurred a bn charge and bn reduction of shareholders equity as a result of some off balance sheet dealings the company has also become the subject of a securities and exchange commission investigation as a result of those dealings since that announcement the company s share price has fallen more than per cent and enron s long term debt has been downgraded by all three leading credit rating agencies but despite the pr crisis enron has repeatedly stressed that its core trading business has been performing well enron counterparties growing wariness comes at a time of continuing nervousness over the company s balance sheet one of the company s first actions after the initial announcement was to draw down bn of bank lines to protect itself against fickle commercial paper lenders spurning it then earlier this week enron followed that up by raising bn from a secured credit line co arranged by jp morgan chase and citigroup at the time of the new bank deal an official close to the bank group described the funds as comfort funds which the company could simply stack up in the lobby in order to reassure investors unfortunately the loan does not seem to have reassured investors as much as was hoped enron is now talking to private equity firms including the blackstone group about supporting it with a bn investment off balance

slumped to its lowest point in years on reports that the houston based energy giant is stumping for a cash infusion of billion or more the fear among executives across many energy sectors is that enron s ability to maintain markets in contracts for electricity and natural gas would collapse under the weight of its falling credit standing and the growing reluctance of other energy companies to do business with it enron is the world s largest trader of energy contracts taking in more than billion in revenue in the first nine months of this year from buying and selling electric power and natural gas contracts worth more than billion in aggregate industry sources estimate that enron is involved in one third of all energy contracts if such a market maker could not function because of lack of financing the ripple effects could be a disaster for energy industries experts said what we re seeing is a threat to far more than a single company or even a single industry one energy investor said leading energy executives have been approached by institutional investors to consider forming a new management team sources said tuesday such a team would step in at enron to work out its difficulties which stem from transactions and obligations the company evidently made with at least off balance sheet partnerships from which enron managers profited lawyers suing the company say enron used the affiliated partnerships to hide liabilities from shareholders investors also have accused company executives of conflicts of interest because they acted on investments for both the company and the partnerships the thinking in energy circles in houston and elsewhere sources said is that enron chairman and ceo lay would have to resign to allow the company to attract fresh

analyst ralph pellecchia said his agency would drop enron to junk status if the company made no progress in reducing its debt if its trading business were to show signs of significant deterioration or if expenses and charges from noncore businesses it is selling should exceed current estimates a rating below investment grade would present further obstacles to enron s ability to continue making markets in electricity and natural gas supplies a fall below investment grade also would trigger early repayment of billion in bonds that otherwise would not be due until and there are a lot of things they can do that people might perceive as being positive pellecchia said they are trying to show that they have the cash available and the capacity of managing their businesses over time of getting out of bad businesses and running their business more openly and transparently obviously this is a process enron s troubles have cascaded of late the company reported a million loss in the third quarter and a billon reduction in shareholder equity after two years in which its annual revenue more than trebled the company led a trend in energy trading creating an internet based network enrononline that allowed millions of suppliers and purchasers of electricity natural gas oil and coal to trade with one another enron made markets in all those commodities putting up its own capital to buy and sell them it is that key role as a clearinghouse that has put enron in greatest peril because it needs a continuing flow of cash to act as the buyer for every seller and the seller to every buyer said philip k verleger jr a newport beach energy economist enron is now trying to reach out to other people to get them to fund this enrononline but a lot of companies have been moving business out of enron he said ironically california is in the position to help push enron deeper into trouble verleger said that is because enron is owed millions of dollars by california for electricity sold to the state and its utilities during the power crisis and enron in its role as market maker probably has a hand in many of the controversial long term power contracts signed this year by the state gov gray davis other politicians and state regulators have repeatedly accused enron of overcharging for electricity if gray davis were to pull the plug on the state s electricity deals with enron or other firms he quite possibly could put enron into bankruptcy verleger said how quickly things change if enron were to collapse he said much of the company s trading business could simply migrate to smaller competitors as happened when junk bond powerhouse drexel burnham lambert inc folded in but such a collapse could seriously damage the trading of electricity he said because enron pioneered

closer to the day when it runs out of rate cutting ammunition and that raises an unsettling question could the u s be going down the same dismal economic path trod by japan a decade ago with each passing week the similarities increase in the s japan was considered the model capitalist economy in the s the u s held that distinction in both cases the good times ended with the bursting of a stock market bubble pricked at least in part by a nervous central bank in both cases predictions of a quick turnaround proved to be wrong the excessive american investment in fiber optic high speed phone lines echoes japan s decade earlier investment binge in memory chip factories the plight of one well respected american company enron corp which has lost two thirds of its market value in just three weeks is reminiscent of the previously invisible weakness japan s slump exposed at many of that country s banks even the recent squabbling in the u s congress that threatens to derail a package of economic stimulus measures sounds eerily similar to the bureaucratic and political wrangling that stymied bold fixes in japan and now u s monetary policy considered to be the most powerful tool for countering the nation s downturns is looking increasingly like japan s as interest rates fall toward zero japan has endured a decade of stagnation could that happen here most analysts continue to answer with a resounding no they point out that japan burst not just a stock market bubble but also a real estate bubble which in turn laid low its banking system the u s bubble appears to have been limited to stocks and the american banking system remains strong u s policy makers also insist that they are wiser than their japanese counterparts in part because they have learned from japan s mistakes and they add the u s economic and political system is more flexible than japan s and better able to make the necessary repairs it s easy to raise the suspicion that the japanese and american economies have some similarities u s treasury secretary paul o neill said in a recent interview i don t think it s apt to make a comparison among other things he says they re not an open economy one of the things that has really been beneficial to our economy is this openness and the challenge that we have permitted to come in here from foreign suppliers from all over the world moreover the u s central bank hasn t yet exhausted its rate cutting options in announcing its half point rate cut yesterday the fed s policy committee made clear that it remained poised to keep cutting rates down into the range if deemed necessary for the foreseeable future it declared the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness u s markets have rallied in recent weeks on the assumption that the fed still will be able to turn things around by next year indeed after trading a bit lower yesterday in the hours before the fed s p m est rate announcement the dow jones industrial average soared points or to finish at just points below its close the day before the sept terrorist attacks on the u s fed chairman alan greenspan continues to cling to his faith in the u s economy s future the long term prospects for productivity growth and the economy remain favorable and should become evident once the unusual forces restraining demand abate the fed said in its statement yesterday yet the japanese were no less confident about their economy a decade ago even as it slipped into prolonged crisis our foundations are solid declared bank of japan governor yasushi mieno as he started cutting interest rates in japan s nikkei stock average peaked near in december but in when three leading economic institutes issued long term forecasts for japan through the next decade and beyond each saw long term economic growth continuing at between and a year instead the country grew at an annual average of between and in april as the nikkei appeared to be hitting bottom at a consensus of a dozen top forecasters still foresaw japanese economic growth for the following year at between and it ended up growing today the nikkei hovers around and the japanese economy is back in its fourth recession of the past decade one reason for the unexpected length and depth of japan s decline is that its s bubble created a myriad of destructive excesses many of which became evident only after the bubble popped for example it wasn t until that real estate prices started falling and many analysts thought that decline would be temporary it wasn t until the mid s that economists saw how severely the fall in real estate prices had hurt japan s big banks those bad investments continue to haunt japanese banks the banks didn t lend so much directly to real estate speculators instead much of the money went through intermediaries such as non bank finance companies and construction companies today many of those contractors are near insolvency and the banks may have to take huge write offs we recognized that it would take a long time to be fixed but even so we thought that would mean two or three years yoshimasa nishimura a former head of the japanese finance ministry s banking bureau says of the bubble and it took manufacturers many years to recognize that the capacity they had built up during the bubble was never going to be used auto makers manufactured million vehicles including trucks and buses in japan in the number fell off gradually after that and now stands at about million per year for years companies kept excess capacity and workers betting that the falloff was temporary when japan s economy first slowed there was widespread confidence that its government could easily manage the downturn in the s the country s fabled bureaucrats had a sterling reputation for economic management much as mr greenspan did in the u s during the s with short term interest rates at and a budget surplus of trillion yen billion or of gross domestic product the japanese central bank and parliament had plenty of room to cut rates cut taxes and boost public spending the bank of japan did ultimately cut rates by almost all six percentage points politicians used the full surplus and even let the government run a primary budget deficit or deficit excluding bond issuance and repayment of trillion yen or of gdp but they acted too slowly and in the end failed to jump start the economy american policy makers give themselves higher marks for speed of response the fed has cut interest rates by percentage points in just months it took the bank of japan more than years to do the same moreover the u s congress has turned unprecedented budget surpluses into almost certain deficits with equal dispatch passing a massive trillion year tax cut earlier this year and rapidly approving billion in stimulus measures and a billion airline bailout in the wake of the sept terrorist attacks members of congress now are caught up in a stalemate over a plan for billion to billion in additional stimulus actions but that too has a good chance of enactment before year s end the japanese diet on the other hand dallied for a year and a half before passing its first stimulus package even more important than the speed of america s policy makers though may be the flexibility of the american economy itself analysts say the u s economy has a more self cleansing form of capitalism that discourages the many excesses that built up in japan during the s a decade ago the japanese boasted of having found the secret formula for smoothing out free market business cycles companies had friendly shareholders as well as bankers who provided patient capital that allowed for long term technological investments in spite of weak quarterly earnings lifetime employment guarantees gave workers a sense of income security encouraging them to keep spending during downturns in retrospect those same traits seem like weaknesses factors that shielded japanese companies from the free market pressures that would have made them more efficient the u s system by contrast is considered better equipped to shift resources from unproductive to productive uses even today after the decade long slump the japanese company matsushita electric industrial co refuses to lay off any of its employees in japan despite losses that are expected to exceed billion this year that s a far cry from u s companies such as international business machines corp and at t corp which laid off workers even during the boom years freeing up technology talent to go to newer fast growing rivals such as dell computer corp or cisco systems inc in part it is u s policy makers willingness to inflict short term pain that allows for that flexibility american officials argue that japan would have come out of its crisis more quickly if it had handled its banking crisis the way the u s handled the american savings and loan crisis in the s back then u s government ordered thrift shutdowns and foreclosures caused shareholders to lose their investments and borrowers to lose their properties in japan failed banks were propped up and their problems allowed to fester still american style free markets are hardly immune from excesses and more and more become apparent the longer the economy idles telecom companies spent tens of billions of dollars to lay tens of millions of miles of fiber optic cables an estimated of which is now being used blue chip american express co ended up writing off more than billion in junk bond investments that were considered relatively low risks until the economy went sour subprime lender providian financial corp sent its earnings and stock price soaring in the late s by tapping the once largely ignored pool of consumers with checkered borrowing records providian insisted that it used sophisticated models to limit its risks nonetheless it ended up announcing a surprising drop in third quarter earnings last month and its stock fell by more than half more surprises are almost certainly in store many analysts argue that the u s stock market even at more than below its peak remains a bubble waiting to deflate further the standard poor s stock index still is trading at a price to earnings ratio of between and times earnings depending on the measurement and would need to fall at least to reach its historic average p e ratio of according to the leuthold group a minneapolis based investment research firm to some analysts the large amount of consumer debt outstanding in the u s is the ticking time bomb that could rival the bad loans dragging down japanese banks american households borrowed freely and dipped deeply into savings during the s in good times with wages and stock portfolios rising the situation seemed manageable but now as income growth slows and mutual funds shrink the burden could spin out of control the fed estimates that the household debt service burden the ratio of debt payments to after tax income rose above earlier this year for the first time since at about the same time the number of americans filing for personal bankruptcy hit a record one reason for the surge in american borrowing has been a sharp increase in the number of new home mortgages and a wave of mortgage refinancing to take advantage of falling interest rates and rising home values both home sales and consumer spending backed by rising housing values have been rare bright spots over the past year in an otherwise dismal economy but there are dangers as well one concern that the sharp rise in home prices over the past four years nearly nationally when adjusted for inflation and more than in hot markets such as silicon valley according to the office of federal housing enterprise oversight in washington could turn into a miniature version of japan s real estate bubble another worry that america s housing market isn t driven entirely by free market forces rather this theory goes it is propped up by japan like government subsidies and easy loan terms made possible by widespread assumptions that the government would pick up the tab for any defaults the nation s mortgage market is dominated by fannie mae and freddie mac government chartered companies that are shareholder owned but still enjoy various implicit and explicit subsidies such as tax breaks and an emergency line of credit from the u s treasury the two washington area companies don t actually issue mortgages themselves instead they buy mortgages from lenders and repackage them into tradable securities in doing so they play a major role in influencing the size and shape of the market by setting underwriting standards for the loans they purchase some conservatives including the fed s mr greenspan have expressed concern that fannie and freddie by using government subsidies to expand the housing market create distortions drawing capital away from more productive uses the congressional budget office estimates that the two companies last year enjoyed subsidies totaling billion a number they say is exaggerated other critics say that the companies encourage more and riskier lending than a completely free market would allow a pattern that may sustain housing demand in the near term but raises the risk of a bigger bust down the road japan s woes have been exacerbated by formal and informal government backing for lenders that includes a government housing loan corp that gets a billion annual subsidy and a separate state run loan guarantee program that keeps many technically bankrupt small businesses afloat fannie mae chairman frank raines rejects the notion of any similarity between his company and japanese style subsidies their mortgage corporation has no private market discipline there is no private management no private equity capital no private debt capital fannie he says has all three as well as tight regulatory standards requiring the company to keep enough capital on hand to withstand a catastrophe the company s private shareholders he adds have every incentive to prevent overly risky lending since they would lose their investments even if the government were to intervene to back the loans elsewhere on the business front the vaunted flexibility of the american economy while perhaps raising efficiency in the long run could also serve to intensify a downturn american corporations readiness to resort to layoffs at the first sign of weakness risks battering consumer confidence in the past three months alone the unemployment rate has soared by nearly a full percentage point to in october from in august and the u s jobless rate once again exceeds japan s which after a decade of stagnation still is even workers supposedly protected by union contracts have a fragile safety net in the wake of the terrorist attacks major airlines such as amr corp s american airlines and delta air lines invoked force majeure clauses in their labor contracts allowing them to skirt many negotiated protections and dump workers without advance notice partly as a result the conference board s index of consumer confidence plunged to in october from in august one of the swiftest declines on record while japan s unique circumstances may account for some of its problems they also may demonstrate a broader and more disturbing point that policy may at times be relatively powerless to contain the destructive forces of a bursting bubble as companies are saddled with excess capacity they have little incentive to borrow to expand no matter how low interest rates fall even after the sharp drop in capital spending over the past year the percentage of industrial capacity in use in the u s in september was just the lowest level since and hardly an inducement for companies to build new factories layoff spooked consumers also may be unwilling to spend tax rebates enacted to encourage shopping a recent university of michigan survey concluded that just over one in five households have spent the rebate checks mailed out this summer with the rest tucking the money into savings or using it to pay debt at the extreme the supply overhang from a collapsing bubble can touch off a dangerous cycle of deflation or falling prices in a deflationary environment consumers curb spending waiting for goods to become still cheaper in the future borrowers get crushed by debt burdens as their loans become more expensive in relative terms companies forced to keep cutting prices cut back on workers and purchases of supplies spreading pain throughout the

finding osama bin laden we keep pumping gasoline into our suvs as if oil and war like oil and water never mix yet we re fighting in a part of the world where a misstep or assassination could shock the

i think it would be a good idea for us all to get together and discuss this isssue from a legal and credit perspective original message from lebrocq wendi sent friday september am to rohauer tanya subject fw trades as ena regards wendi lebrocq original message from white bill sent friday september am to boyd justin dyk russell shackleton sara shankman jeffrey a cc abramo caroline zivic robyn diamond daniel radous paul lebrocq wendi sharma shifali juggins janine nelson roderick subject re trades as ena justin your solution appears to respond specifically to eol related legal credit issues however isn t this only the tip of the iceberg what about non eol otc trades conducted by ectric traders with counterparties that want ena as their counterparty from my time in london it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory sfa issues please comment also as a commercially efficient course of action it has always seemed to me that we should attempt to train our couterparties to accept that ectric is also a enron corp guaranteed sub at least it was in the past at their request and somehow initially set up our contracts isda to be inclusive of this vehicle is this possible otherwise the permutations of various legal credit tax regulatory hurdles for all manner of otc trades becomes onerous bill original message from boyd justin sent september to dyk russell shackleton sara white bill shankman jeffrey a cc abramo caroline zivic robyn diamond daniel radous paul lebrocq wendi sharma shifali juggins janine nelson roderick subject re trades as ena russell my view would be to follow the novation route i e c p trades via eol with ectric each trade is novated from ectric to ena and treated as concluded under ena isda master ena enters into back to back trade with ectric this does mean that the c p must initially accept the european eol gtcs though if we set up a mechanism whereby eol trades are automatically novated to ena and treated as concluded under the ena isda master this effectively cancels out the eol gtcs justin original message from dyk russell sent september to shackleton sara boyd justin white bill shankman jeffrey a cc abramo caroline zivic robyn diamond daniel radous paul lebrocq wendi sharma shifali subject fw trades as ena everyone our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing brent and other european product deals w our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ena the entity with which all the funds have isdas we just did two wti brent crude oil spreads today one w very large volume and expect to be doing more such deals this is more than just a legal issue it s going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on eol as well as we understand it the main legal issue is that all the funds have an isda only w ena and not w ectric so they and i assume we want all deals and legal exposure to be w ena to satisfy both parties desires all european product deals must be booked from ectric to ena sara from speaking to you and from justin s response below it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we the funds and our traders might face is if no trader w ena in houston okays w the counterparty on ena s behalf however there seem to be other solutions a netting agreement and novating that get around this as sara knows dealing on legal agreements w the funds can be onerous and time consuming negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option from the credit side as we understand it the issue w not back to backing the trades w ena is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds net position in houston and therefore not monitored in other words any exposure not sitting w ena will be invisible to credit so daily margining etc will be incorrect from the enrononline side as we see it there are a couple of issues eol wants the funds to trade online an increasing number of funds also want to trade online however they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only us based also they would like to see more arb spread products like a wti brent crude oil spread online if neither desire can be easily met b c we need a separate isda w ectric which potentially means as above more onerous and time consuming negotiation then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now the point has been raised that the funds could trade european products if credit in london cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on eol we can assure you that they will not accept this these are the issues as we see them from the origination side there may be other issues that we re missing from the sides that i ve mentioned as well as the trading back office side regards russ original message from white bill sent thursday september pm to dyk russell subject fw trades as ena original message from sharma shifali sent july to white bill subject fw trades as ena this is what we have heard from legal and tax so far we re trying to get a list of couterparties that currently will not trade with ectric and only with ena original message from boyd justin sent thursday july am to juggins janine beyhum maya cc sharma shifali klar guenther sexton camille watt julie marsh jonathan subject re trades as ena i agree assuming you follow janine s approach then no adverse uk regulatory issues will ensue justin original message from juggins janine sent july to beyhum maya boyd justin cc sharma shifali klar guenther sexton camille watt julie subject re trades as ena i assume that these are financial transactions the current approach is the right one in the circumstances i e trade between ectric and ena trade between ena and third party eg bank of america it is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ena is located in houston they cannot agree deals in the name of ena when located in london the pricing should be such that ena is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ectric to avoid booking the back to back trades a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ectric ena and bank of america if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position another alternative sometimes put forward is that ectric does the deal with bank of america the contract is then novated from ectric to ena and ena enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ectric note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through efet llc arranged by eeft instead of ectric effective november regards janine original message from beyhum maya sent july to juggins janine boyd justin cc sharma shifali subject trades as ena hi i am currently working in the london risk group for global markets at the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ectric but would like to do deals only with ena e g bank of america as a result if a london trader wants to carry out a trade with bank of america he will do an internal trade with a trader in houston and then book a trade between the houston trader who trades under ena and bank of america the trades are then confirmed from the houston office we were wondering about a couple of things are there any tax legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ectric as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration thanks for your help maya,Data Breach,Phishing,0.653232062175052,False
business highlights enron global markets coal and emissions trading the first enron online synfuel trade occurred this past week establishing enrononline as the only online marketplace for synfuel the purpose of bringing synfuel on enrononline is to provide market transparency between the coal synfuel spread the coal cash book which began trading only two months ago has traded over million spot tons the fundamental purpose of this book is to capture short term market discrepancies while also adding liquidity to the spot market to further long term trading and marketing of coal enron energy and operational services ena solid fuel initiative ena started development of a coal initiative late last year to support the electricity trading desk and to provide enron with a hedge in the event that the cost of natural gas continues to escalate above current long term projections because of the culture shock associated the use of the words enron and coal in the same sentence consideration was been given to changing the name to dng dense natural gas however we went with solid fuel initiative this initiative is developing multiple sites throughout the country where ena feels there is the greatest opportunity for long term corporate benefit the primary areas are texas florida southeastern ohio and the central rocky mountain area there are principal areas currently being aggressively pursued brownsville tx and brighton fl in brownsville the team secured formal owner approval to lease a acre site near the brownsville ship channel this approval will allow the formal permitting activities to proceed without delay a mw facility is being considered for brownsville as conceptualized it will consist of two mw net cfb units circulating fluidized bed boilers the boilers will be fired by petroleum coke petcoke and use a technology that will generate electricity in the most environmentally friendly way currently possible one of the advantages of locating this facility near brownsville is that it remains a steady growth area and there is already serious interest by others to take substantial initial base load capacity there is further synergy with other developing projects in the area that could lock down additional base capacity as stated the plant is initially mw but will be designed to be expanded to a mw facility the eeos team is starting to grow and currently includes hilda akin cheryl kent project admin assistants bill fox as pem and paula solomon as pcm as the project develops there will be more team members required in addition as the florida opportunity develops we plan to establish a separate team esource esource enron s research group recently posted on its website a forrester report as well as analyst reports for various industry and

last night linda and i spent a fairly long time with leon lowery chairman bingaman s chief electricity advisor to discuss our concerns with the transparency and market based rate language while at the same time commending the transmission access language in the draft and strategizing how to support the chairman in that regard we made progress on transparency less so on market based rates on transparency leon understands our concerns in a nutshell he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transaction specific trade specific information we persuaded leon that was the impact of the initial language although he initially said details would be left to ferc we persuaded him that if any data is to be provided it must be only in aggregate form we also impressed on him that if as he said the intent is to leave details to ferc then more of the details should be left to ferc not set by statute leon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections this will make it easier for leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff sam fowler th chief counsel is a drafting stickler others should obviously weigh in and review this but to facilitate internal comments we need to get back to leon today here is my take on what he has in mind under new sec b to be added to the fpa by bill sec pg under information required we would rewrite paragraph as follows each broker exchange or other market making entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce the effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy by leaving it as aggregate statistical information this should give ferc maximum flexibility to permit indexes etc as to the timely basis of information release subsection c the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the internet after the end of the trading day if we can restrict this to aggregate data question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily that suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want i think here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give ferc more leeway c timely basis the commission shall require the information required under subsection b to be posted on the internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriate the change is to add appropriate so that ferc can consider other than whether posting is practicable the use of appropriate is what came to mind perhaps there is some other word or phrase like consistent with or promote competition or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability there should be some valid purpose established before data is released i would argue that the d language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure not when disclosure is appropriate please let me have your thoughts although the tragedy in nyc and dc now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the hill will provide a further report on market based rates in sum leon was not as sympathetic on this issue but asked for our ideas and further arguments we sense leon personally feels strongly about moving the fpa to some linkage to competitive markets his argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets we pushed that penalizing us is not the answer nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down leon clearly does not intend this language to punish enron but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets,Data Breach,Phishing,0.48070733417249284,False

washington post ferc taken to task over calif energy crisis mime version content type text plain charset iso content disposition inline fyi ferc taken to task over calif energy crisis by peter behr washington post staff writer friday april page e even before president bush took office he and his staff were trying keep california s energy crisis a long arm s length away saying it was primarily california s problem to solve but the bush white house inherited an unavoidable link to california the federal energy regulatory commission a relatively small washington agency with a large mandate to see that wholesale electricity rates remain just and reasonable california s calamity is defined in part by a battle between ferc and state officials over what just and reasonable means on wednesday ferc made a new effort to hold down california s electricity prices without forsaking its commitment to energy deregulation earning another round of sharp criticism from california officials ferc had a chance to bring meaningful relief to california s outrageous wholesale prices and they blew it california gov gray davis d said yesterday the spotlight is bright and unsought for an agency with a modest million budget born in as the federal power commission a weak understaffed agency that promoted and supervised hydropower dams fifteen year later during president franklin d roosevelt s new deal battle against powerful utility holding companies the commission was armed with the authority to regulate rates for wholesale electricity bought by utilities and for power transmission states regulate retail rates today ferc makes rules for the nation s transition away from regulated utility electric service to a market based hybrid in california and many major states powerful generating companies compete to sell electricity to utilities which act as distributors the responsibilities have taxed ferc s staff of which is about percent less than peak levels during the mid s a backlog of pending cases includes not just conflicts over power prices but also critical issues of reorganizing the nation s power transmission network into large regional pools strong enough to make urgently needed investments in new lines when congress set electricity deregulation in motion in ferc s goal became seeing that it succeeded gradually it redefined the just and reasonable standard saying that as long as electricity markets were competitive the prices negotiated by generators and distributors met the standard in hewing to that doctrine the agency turned down an increasingly angry flood of demands from davis and a host of california officials to clamp down on the state s wholesale electricity prices when they suddenly shot upward last summer although ferc concluded in november that california s power market was badly flawed and that the potential for unfair and unjust pricing existed it did not impose hard price restraints opting for a soft partial price ceiling ferc ordered california to try to fix its broken power purchasing system by buying the bulk of its electricity through long term supply contracts with generators rather than through last minute purchases that forced the state to pay generators and marketers top prices but ferc s plan was not implemented they have the ability to resolve it and they are not following through with what we asked them to ferc chairman curt hebert jr said three months ago just after being named chairman by bush but under growing political pressure to restrain california s extraordinary wholesale electricity charges and respond to complaints of overcharging ferc has moved deeper into the morass since march it has ordered power suppliers to refund million or prove that their charges were justified the generators say their prices have been based on high costs of natural gas and air pollution permits we re very confident that ferc will see that these issues and transactions were just and reasonable said randy harrison chief executive for western operations of mirant a major california generator on wednesday the commission went further directing california to establish maximum rates that generators could charge during power shortage emergencies through a formula linked to plant operating costs all generators would be entitled to get the highest approved price but suppliers that exceeded the price benchmark would have to justify their prices or face refund orders the decision on a to vote reflects a compromise between the agency s desire to defend the troubled experiment with deregulation while protecting consumers against overcharging said energy consultant peter fox penner of the brattle group they re searching for middle ground here it s not what we think of as price caps he said it s flexible it s related to costs and that s very innovative but ferc s many critics in california rebuked the agency again yesterday saying its actions were too little and too late because the new ferc rules would apply only during power emergencies there would be no price restraint at other times some said and by pegging approved rates to the costs of plants burning costly natural gas ferc s order would confront california with continuing costs of per megawatt hour for large quantities of electricity this summer eight to times what the state was paying before the crisis critics said what they did do is virtually irrelevant said harvey rosenfield of the foundation for taxpayer consumer rights it s like offering someone who s been hit by a car an aspirin ferc has failed its responsibilities at every point in the crisis said adam goldberg a policy analyst with consumers union hebert responds that slapping hard price regulations on california s energy market is the wrong course for at least three reasons it does not encourage generators to build more plants it doesn t prompt consumers to conserve energy and it will prompt power suppliers to sell electricity to neighboring states where prices aren t controlled unless california blocks power exports what lessons the public will draw from california s plight this summer and the deregulation debate remains to be seen but ferc and perhaps the bush administration too has been pulled more closely than ever into that drama special correspondent jeff adler contributed to this article the washington post company,Phishing,Data

energy shortages new demand for enron by elizabeth r smith the new york times page column c new york times company california s rolling blackouts and a looming energy crisis in other parts of the country are stoking investor interest in companies positioned to reap benefits from the power shortages many investors stunned by the market s precipitous fall see energy as one of the few sectors with a promising profit outlook and in that so called energy merchant sector the enron corporation stands out as the industry leader based in houston it buys and sells wholesale electricity natural gas and scores of other commodities including broadband capacity for data delivery services in the fourth quarter of enron s revenue more than tripled to billion from the period a year earlier that mushrooming revenue can be traced to the unprecedented surge in the price of electricity and natural gas particularly in california on tuesday california power regulators approved a percent increase in electricity rates the largest in the state s history electricity shortfalls have also been predicted for new york city this summer despite its red hot market enron is no bargain its share price surged percent in to end the year at up from a year earlier it hit a month intraday high of on aug around the time that california s utilities first sounded the alarm and even though enron has taken some hits this year the stock closed at on friday times its earnings per share well above its peers on march it fell to a month low of amid concerns about possible layoffs in its broadband operations but rebounded after jeffrey k skilling the chief executive assured investors that all was well in broadband enron s edge is its sheer size and its recognized competence in helping corporate clients cope with unprecedented swings in electricity prices enron in turn charges a premium to manage the risk of energy price movements said donato j eassey a natural gas analyst at merrill lynch they have market intelligence that is second to none he said they help firms lower the cost by avoiding the spot market for power the value of enron s broadband effort and its core wholesale energy operations have yet to be fully reflected in its stock price he added predicting that shares will climb to in months raymond c niles an analyst at salomon smith barney also likes enron because of its dominance the company has unit operating margins that are two to three times that of its closest competitor dynegy in wholesale energy he said when the heat is on literally people need a company like enron for physical delivery because it has so many ways to get them that resource he predicted that the stock would rise to within months neither analyst is worried about developments in india where enron was forced to invoke government guarantees to recoup payment for power generated at its dabhol power plant in the state of maharashtra other experts favor enron because it is not just a pure power play the company which is shedding many of its hard assets has bet heavily on its prospects for buying and selling broadband capacity skeptics say the demand for broadband is nowhere near as immediate as the need for energy but amy m jaffe a senior energy adviser at the james a baker iii institute for public policy at rice university in houston said enron was smart to move into broadband they might be in broadband too early but that s o k she said there will be demand for it enron s expansion into data delivery as well as its market making of energy commodities help distinguish it from classic energy businesses like oil companies she said lawrence r fuller a senior portfolio manager at the merrill lynch fundamental growth fund says enron is his largest energy holding the company is controversial because its valuation is very high mr fuller said but they have a tremendous lead over their rivals and a mastery of their business you have tremendous economies of scale here that drive their profit copyright dow jones company inc all rights reserved outlook editorials pull the plug not enough sunshine on politics of water board staff houston chronicle star copyright the time has come to pull the plug on the houston area water corp the citizen board called the hawk that is in the process of recommending a company to design build and operate a water plant at lake houston the members of the hawk board appear to have done their job thoroughly and conscientiously the board s chairman attorney david berg has been commendably outspoken about his concerns for the bidding process and the wherewithal of azurix corp a troubled affiliate of energy giant enron corp and one of three companies in the final running for the contract however the political maneuverings and pressures being placed behind the scenes on both city staff evaluating the bid proposals and the hawk board bear much more scrutiny than can be gained in the format of this quasi private corporation city attorney anthony hall reported the chronicle s mary flood started an hourlong heated argument with berg at a march mayoral fund raiser over the possibility that azurix rumored as the favorite of mayor lee brown s administration might not win the bid sources familiar with the argument told flood that hall threatened berg that he would dismantle the hawk if the process that kept azurix as the winning recommendation was not followed hall denied he said anything like that saying his complaints were about procedures berg would not comment specifically on that matter hall according to flood s report said he told berg that because the companies had relied on a long established formula for choosing the front runner it would invite trouble to change or ignore the formula now but the companies said they were never told about the formula and have had nothing specific to rely on about how the staff or the hawk board would make its decision the pressure brought to bear on the hawk in such an unsavory way and without public controls is extremely troubling these boards clearly were never intended to handle projects so politically divisive with so much money at stake the water plant contract under bid is worth million the water project it is part of could reach billion state rep garnet coleman d houston who wrote the statute allowing local government corporations such as hawk said he never intended these citizen boards to handle projects as large as the water plant politicians who want to guide this process ought to be willing to do it openly and face both the public scrutiny and the consequences of their actions for that reason not because the bid award may not go the way the city administration wants it to the hawk corporation should be dissolved copyright dow jones company

century gas and electric names the short answer is yes we should have seen the darkness coming we saw instead the brightness of our beliefs about this golden place we had mistaken california for a continent nearly a universe from which everything we wanted would come endlessly because we expected it to california at the beginning of was turning raw aspiration into profit as quickly as post civil war america had and with nearly the same confident mixture of technological bravura and financial cunning in blacked out deregulated january after the briefest of gilded ages we found that california really is an island on the land just as its most perceptive observers had said it was and that california s energy resources are as fragile and limited as any island s we would have been better served if in our haste we had paused to read two timely books on the history of power and its regulation while they do not foreshadow california s current electrical mess they throw some historical light on why we re in the dark in the natural gas market sixty years of regulation and deregulation by paul w macavoy the problem is the inadequacy of the regulatory models that states and federal agencies have applied to natural gas production and distribution since the s none macavoy says made natural gas plentiful cheap and profitable all at the same time and no one producers pipeline operators retailers or consumers has benefited from the failed attempts the current natural gas shortage driving up household bills and the operating costs of california s gas fueled electricity plants is the result macavoy would argue of regulatory approaches that can t work macavoy believes a rational market could be made for natural gas through complete deregulation except for the irrationality of consumers they don t see natural gas as a substance less commodity to be priced and delivered by the workings of the market forces that interest macavoy a professor at yale s school of management consumers see gas and electricity as something real like sunlight or air that flows predictably from a second nature of pipelines and transmission towers the presence in the landscape of these grids like the grids of aqueducts and highways is so necessary and expected that ordinary nature is unimaginable without them californians have superimposed a man made second nature of energy production and distribution on the state s unforgiving landscapes too but our unique problem is a gold rush mythology of abundance limitless power is part of the myth beginning with the belief in the s and s that california s hills having yielded gold for the taking would yield coal just as abundantly to power the state s transition to an industrial economy california had plenty of gold it turned out but almost no coal nor could the state produce enough firewood where people needed it or kerosene to fuel its lamps or manpower to till its fields wood coal kerosene and labor were power crises in the th century that were ultimately resolved by technical innovation resource substitution and historically higher energy costs for california consumers in the th century new believers preached that the sierra nevada foothills would flow with endless hydropower to keep city lights shining that more oil fields were ready to be discovered to fuel the state s power plants and that nuclear technology would make electricity too cheap to meter it hardly mattered that there was no foundation for these beliefs either our resilient faith in a second nature of power that is adequate to the myth of california gives james c williams energy and the making of modern california its poignancy williams whose book was published in hardcover in does not forecast the deregulation crisis of but he might have speaking of americans generally williams says they have believed each new energy resource to be without fault to be infinitely abundant and therefore to have the potential to effect utopian societal change moreover people s faith in an energy resource seems to persist until its shortcomings are obvious and only then do they see it cannot bring utopia yet the failure of a resource to live up to their expectations has not seemed to dampen their enthusiasm as they simply transfer the myth from a fallen energy resource to the next resource appropriated for use in the california legislature simply substituted a deregulated electricity marketplace as the next energy resource expected to work on utopian principles williams ends his account of california s energy history at the hopeful moment in the late s when a diversified innovative and less centralized energy paradigm seemed ascendant although not as radical as environmental purists wanted he says california s emphasis on energy conservation and alternative power sources solar geothermal wind and biomass among them defined a more benign and flexible soft energy path paralleling the hard energy path of gas fired steam generators nuclear plants and hydroelectric dams between and williams reports california s population grew and its economy as measured in goods and services grew while the state s energy consumption grew only in part because of some of the strictest standards in the world for building insulation and appliance efficiency jerry brown california governor from through was right after all weather stripping and windmills do make a difference brown s career needs no rehabilitation now as he begins his campaign for a second term as mayor of oakland but the debacle of electrical deregulation is set to consume other political futures when electricity bills jump in may to a projected by the end of summer sen steve peace d el cajon and public utilities commission president loretta lynch will take the fall gov gray davis probably will too the blame for the state s slide into deregulated chaos goes well beyond today s cast of bewildered politicians but californians are unlikely to round up all the suspects ourselves included who might be made to answer for it we were too distracted by the collapse of the state s old economy in the l a riots earthquakes and other disasters to attend to the tedium of energy policy no one seemed to notice how electricity deregulation launched without much meaningful debate in recycled the myth of energy abundance that williams lucidly details decade by decade beginning in or that deregulation required a rapid and sustained increase in generating capacity if it was going to deliver the substantially lower electricity costs promised for that was wishful thinking long before the legislature s unanimous deregulation vote in john bryson chief executive of southern california edison told the california public utilities commission edison does not need any additional power until at least bryson s declaration that california faced an energy glut not a shortage was in response to a controversial decision by the puc ordering the state s major utilities to purchase megawatts of new power annually beginning in the puc order was driven by a california energy commission forecast fairly accurate it turns out that californians would need megawatts of electricity in the actual usage was closer to megawatts to foster competitors to the state s largest utilities pacific gas electric edison and san diego gas electric the puc order also required them to buy all this new power from independent suppliers whose presence in california s limited energy market would the puc believed not only deliver the required megawatts but also gradually cut consumer electric bills in addition the puc ordered the three utilities to buy part of this new power from suppliers using alternative and renewable energy sources windmills geothermal and solar continuing california s successful experiment in a parallel industry of soft energy supply the utilities resisted with deregulation the goal of the clinton administration as much as of the power industry the puc s order to buy more electricity and expand the small is beautiful supply model that williams believed was possible in when his book was published looked to the utilities like the subsidization of future competitors in edison and sdg e convinced the federal energy regulatory commission that giving environmentally friendly generators preferential treatment was illegal and that california in the midst of a business crunching recession didn t need more power anyway under pressure from the federal commission the puc caved in and edison and sdg e got exactly what they wanted relief from new competition continued centralization of production within the traditional utility grid and a puc committed to demolishing the state s year old system of utility regulation the puc even discouraged the utilities from signing long term supply contracts at current prices because the puc professed to believe that deregulation would generate lower energy prices more quickly than anyone expected to show stockholders that they were no longer the dowdy power companies of the old economy the utilities sweetened short term profits by refusing to invest in plant construction spun off revenues from their puc regulated divisions into stock buybacks and worked very hard for full deregulation their victory a year later was a catastrophe the deregulation consumers got in the ironic words of state sen jim brulte r rancho cucamonga one of the most far reaching and forward thinking pieces of legislation in california history was peculiarly californian in its degree of institutional amnesia as political cover for legislators who feared prices would immediately climb the deregulation bill cut electricity rates and froze increases until march that gave residential consumers and businesses no reason to switch to alternative power sources or conserve more the bill satisfied the interests of consumer advocates because it promised to break the utilities three way monopoly on electricity production and shrink the power of the puc seen as too friendly for too long with the power companies it was supposed to regulate deregulation however continued to shield profits at edison pg e and sdg e by guaranteeing them billion in revenue to cover their massive debt for nuclear power plant construction deregulation also pleased environmentalists because they thought it would take the state further down the soft energy path the deregulation bill encouraged the utilities to sell off their existing fossil fueled generators but it failed to offer enough incentives for the construction of environmentally friendly ones despite the year gap since the construction of the last major power plant anywhere in california finally deregulation created a power market so fragmented that it was ludicrously easy to manipulate when the thin surplus of power supply in the west began evaporating in the summer of although the evidence is masked by the effects of a drought in the northwest which has reduced hydropower and an unlucky combination of plant maintenance air pollution limits idling older plants and higher than expected costs for natural gas the price of bad luck bad weather and the cunning of power suppliers was staggering at one point in december electricity that cost a megawatt hour to produce was priced by the power brokers of the california independent system operator at a megawatt hour that was the negotiated price the suppliers had asked for deregulation had set up a divided marketplace more irrational than any paul w macavoy picks apart in his analysis of natural gas in which the california power exchange was a clearinghouse where buyers and sellers set the price of electricity and the california independent system operator was the buyer of last resort if occasional gaps between production and distribution unexpectedly failed to meet daily demand the arrangement began unraveling in mid and the power exchange effectively collapsed as soon as sdg e became fully deregulated in july leaving the poorly trained bureaucrats of the cal iso in december and january to struggle to buy of the state s daily power needs at arbitrary prices they passed on to utility company managers the spectacle of the cal iso gratefully paying a premium over the cost of production to keep the lights on last winter was a lesson in market fundamentalism with a vengeance californians tutored by earnest neo conservatives such as peace believed that a deregulated market would generate abundant low cost power simply because that s what a market freed of regulation would do despite the evidence that this particular market was based on false assumptions and likely to be manipulated by the energy suppliers who designed it in an empty contest of metaphors in and the dead hand of state regulation had lost to the invisible hand of the marketplace we ll never know if gradual expansion of competition within the framework of regulation would have made california s power system more flexible and environmentally sustainable and less costly to consumers as williams suggested it might power tends to corrupt lord acton said he didn t mean that the powerful are necessarily brutal or cruel he was criticizing the blinding power that flows from unexamined convictions and he was writing about the papacy of pope pius ix who forced the doctrine of papal infallibility on the catholic church the makers of deregulation state legislators consumer advocates puc commissioners and environmentalists were convinced that the market they constructed was infallible too that belief led them to pursue their own self interest in the long run consumers can expect deregulation s perverse effects to include significantly higher electricity bills as we pay off billion in new debt diminished local authority over power plant construction and further disarray among the small scale producers of renewable energy the failure of deregulation also will recast the way power is distributed in california as the state hesitantly moves to control part of the electrical grid in exchange for bonding the utilities debt this first step in creating a state power authority is being resisted by power suppliers who rightly fear that public anger over mismanagement of the power system has hardened into sympathy for public ownership as it almost did in the early s in the short run the failure of deregulation will determine if california s hopeful new economy plays out as something more than the latest of the state s many booms there were extractive ones gold cattle wheat oil suburban house lots and military hardware and there were booms that wove myths health seeking in the sunshine tourism the movies and all the lost dot coms of last year apart from the good and the bad they ve done our state our booms have reflected the belief bordering on religious faith that what is true about california today will be true permanently california s utopian expectations about energy whose history williams diligently surveys are central to that myth it sustained our optimism about california s ability to power itself in the past it s fueling our pessimism today as we lead ourselves deeper into the dark photo nevada transmission line tower at night by john sexton from places of power the aesthetics of technology by

copyright c kasturi sons ltd ksl source world reporter tm asia intelligence wire bangalore march the chief minister mr s m krishna today spoke out strongly against the dumping of ias officers on the state and said a stage would soon be reached when karnataka would have to reject such postings he was replying to the discussion on the budget estimates for in the legislative council the house later passed the appropriation bill moved by the chief minister who also holds the finance portfolio mr krishna who received a round of applause for his stance against the large number of ias and ips officers in the state said the strength of the ias officers was swelling it is only karnataka which is getting a large number of officers from the other states while it is not the case in andhra pradesh and tamil nadu the chief minister said it was not his desire to question the competence of ias officers from outside the state but then i have to be proud of my own people even the few people who pass the central services examination from the state are not posted here a karnataka girl who passed the ias last year was posted to the north east despite her request to be posted in her home state mr krishna reacting to a suggestion by some of the legislators that the house adopt a resolution on this matter said he would rather bring the matter to the notice of the union home minister the centre should rethink on this matter there was also the need for karnataka to have a share of the top posts at the central level i am only expressing the feelings of the people in public administration the centre should focus its attention on this matter referring to the power sector reforms and the union government selecting the state as one of the first beneficiaries the chief minister said the transmission and distribution losses in the state were per cent while the national average was around per cent karnataka could not be an exception from what was happening in the other parts of the country although efforts were now being made to improve the grid situation and ensure metering of all electrical installations which was the key to checking power theft he said it was a blessing in disguise that the state had dropped the mw cogentrix power project in mangalore otherwise the cost of power would have been very high not unlike what maharashtra was now facing with enron the construction of the alamatti power project has been handed over to the karnataka power corporation ltd since the private sector chamundi corporation had quoted rs crores for the project while the kpcl had quoted rs crores our kpcl has a proven track record and the state government decided to go with it the chief minister sounded a note of caution to the excise sector and said the government would come down heavily on it if it continued with tax evasion sale of seconds liquor the government had set an ambitious target of rs crores for the coming year in contrast to rs crores for the revenue from excise had dipped in the mid nineties and had registered a per cent increase over the past two years referring to the interim report of the administrative reforms commission headed by mr haranahalli ramaswamy he said the state had taken a giant step forward in pruning the administrative machinery around per cent of the vacancies which had been frozen over the past decade had now been abolished mr krishna said that the proposal to divert the waters of the west flowing nethravati was only to provide drinking water to around taluks in the plains of the state such a diversion of a small quantum of the waters would in no way affect the agricultural operations along the natural course of the river the government would hold discussions with all the political leaders before arriving at a decision on the proposal he said the chief minister denied the opposition charge on the financial position of the state and said there was no question of walking into a debt trap the loans sought were well within limits the budget presented by him was quite transparent and there was nothing that he had hidden from the public the focus of the budget this year was on agriculture

unfortunately these prospects don t seem to have fired the imagination of home pc users in the country the response to the first few months of broadband connectivity in some affluent localities in delhi and mumbai have been lukewarm mainly because of the cost factor to make matters worse for the industry major players like spectranet and enron have made their intentions clear to exit from their broadband ventures they have set up in delhi and maharashtra respectively spectranet promoter atul punj has decided to withdraw from the fibre optic network business and concentrate on the family s core businesses of construction and pipelines say top sources in the firm the decision follows from the realisation that the business would be dominated by large groups and multinationals analysts too opine that after a frenzied start the broadband market will settle down with fewer players reliance bharti enterprises bpl zee and a few others are left in the fray last fortnight enron also decided to exit from its broadband ventures in the country along with mseb and global telesystems the company had proposed to build a high speed network in india to enable isps and corporate houses to carry

ray managing director data access an affiliate of richard li s pacific convergence corp pcc that has launched network of the world now in india quips it s easy to talk about sexier technologies but are there any taker for them as well according to him shelling out more than rs per month besides coughing up cash for a cable modem is not a sneeze for most of the home pc users another reason points out ray is that players like spectranet can t be compared to big giants like reliance who are into a long haul for spectranet return on investment is vital and with the business plans already going astray they are desperate to get out of this venture he points out while both the broadband players in delhi spectranet and mantra online admit that there is future potential in the home segment for broadband their current subscription figures point out that the boom among home users for broadband services is still a long way off spectranet currently has around subscribers in the home segment while mantra has to make do with only as spectranet managing director uday punj says we are not aggressively marketing the home segment now as the potential in the business segment will any day outflank home demand only that probably they won t be in the market to see that spectranet which was the first off the block in laying optical fibre connections in delhi formally launched its services in october last year the company has already invested around rs crore in setting up kms of optical fibre in delhi noida ghaziabad and bangalore the other broadband player mantra online came with its mantra via cable offer last august mantra s broadband service has till date only covered a few affluent colonies in delhi while one big winner in the delhi s not so hot broadband connections scene has been the cable operators who have provided the crucial last mile connectivity for both mantra and spectranet via their existing network of coaxial cables a major deterrent in the spread of broadband has been the exorbitant cost of the cable modem they come at around rs the return is still not alluring return on investment essentially for the broadband environment the major costs include those of the infrastructure and the subscriber those who are in the process of optical fibre networks are investing about rs crore for covering small towns to large cities more than companies have already acquired infrastructure providers licences which enable them to set up the network right of way towers and infrastructure for end to end connectivity these companies include industry heavyweights like

company s nld plan has synergy with its existing telecom operations it has basic service licence for gujarat and is operating cellular services in madhya pradesh bihar orissa the north east west bengal assam and himachal pradesh it covers more than per cent of the geographical area of the country therefore it will also be able to use the same optical fibre network as the backbone for its existing operations as well as for carrying long distance calls similarly bharti has also announced its plans to enter the nld service segment through spectranet bharti would be able to offer basic

states including delhi and karnataka great expectations despite the hype worldwide broadband penetration is presently very low and india is no exception take for example the united states where only per cent of homes have broadband access while per cent have narrowband access however most analysts say that in the next five years at least per cent of online homes in the us will have broadband access via modems however the asia pacific region is moving faster than the west as far as broadband connectivity is concerned for instance singapore is fully broadband wired similarly taiwan also has an extensive broadband network in place in india it is expected that seven companies will soon be offering their fibre optic cable network commercially internet access via cable will make further

presubscription administrative law judge karen jones has recommended that the public utilities commission require pacific bell to permit mcimetro access transmission services llc s customers to presubscribe to pacific bell s intralata local access and transport area long distance service the recommendation was made in a draft arbitrator s report about the companies interconnection agreement pacific bell said the requirement would be confusing to customers and would require the company to identify a separate billing channel or generate a bill solely for intralata long distance service it is blatantly discriminatory for pacific to refuse to provide intralata toll service to mci s local service customers ms jones said she said pacific s arguments of customer confusion and billing concerns do not have merit customers could receive three different bills for the three different services and other carriers cope with billing for only one of those three services there is no reason that pacific should not be able to provide a bill which includes only intralata services comments on the draft arbitrator s report are due june application california puc extends deadline for pacific

that will support the comments of epsa and wptf and supplement the comments as noted below epsa s comments are generally supportive of the staff report but recommends that ferc clarify that staff s market mitigation measures are being put into place to address structural defects in the california market not the abuse of market power by any market participants avoid the use of cost based rates as a proxy for competitive prices during times of scarcity ensure that if cost based proxy rates are used those rates includes the full value of scarcity capacity opportunity costs and other factors develop proxy rates if necessary using the formula in the march th refund order rather than the unit specific marginal costs identified in the order and forego forced bidding into real time markets

some additional comments on energy limited resources see attached please prove sue mara or i with your comments by cob wednesday thank you alan comnes report summary from epsa stressing that the proposal is designed to apply only to approximately five percent of the market that remains in real time and not to the bilateral and forward markets the report immediately notes that ultimately the real solution to california s problems lies in increased investments in infrastructure the report recommends that the california iso conduct a real time auction with associated measures to mitigate the impact of physical and economic withholding and significant exercises of market power during periods of scarcity coordinating and controlling outages the iso should coordinate and approve all planned outages by units that have a participating generator agreement pga with the iso coordination and outage control procedures should then be coupled with reporting requirements to ferc and dispute review should be expedited similarly the iso should closely monitor unplanned outages and report questionable outages to ferc for further investigation selling obligations all capacity that is available and not scheduled to run under sellers with pgas should be offered in the real time market this obligation would not be imposed on bilateral markets of the iso day ahead markets pga generators would have to submit to ferc a dependable capacity for each unit in addition to other operating parameters necessary to calculate marginal costs such as heat rate ferc staff would then use this data in combination with published fuel costs and emission credit data to determine a price that the iso would use pre determined to mitigate prices during times of reserve deficiency load serving entities should also be required to name their curtailment price and to identify which loads will be curtailed price mitigation when called upon to provide the available and unscheduled capacity as mentioned above pga unit prices would be mitigated in hours when there is a reserve deficiency or stage emergencies the report notes that it is these hours which are extremely conducive to the exercise of market power by suppliers and will be obligated to sell capacity in real time at the marginal cost of the highest priced pga until called upon to run real time price mitigation for each generating unit all generating units should have a standing confidential price based on its marginal costs this price will be used by the iso to establish the real time market clearing price when mitigation is appropriate staff believes that a single market clearing price auction design is appropriate thus reversing the recommendation to use an as bid design in the december order market clearing price all real time energy offers should be paid the applicable market clearing price conditions for invoking mitigation mitigation measures should only be applied to critical operating periods such as emergencies as noted in the report staff recognizes that there are potential difficulties in implementing the proposal and that there are no easy answers to the current problems in the

november a survival kit for tata power bses s ravindran mumbai the two domestic power biggies tata power and bses are vying for enron s per cent stake in the dabhol power company dpc in what seems like a critical battle for survival for both tata power it appears has two primary reasons to bid for dabhol power one it gets a ready built plant when all its other projects are on paper two it also pre empts arch rival bses this is the more important issue for if bses gets dpc it will stop lifting mw of power from tata power for the latter this could be tragic since it cannot possibly find a buyer for the excess power in the vicinity especially since the maharashtra state electricity board mseb says it has enough generation capacity of its own bses on the other hand apart from dealing a severe blow to tata power may also be able take a relook at several of the other contentious projects on hand if bses were to gain control of the mw power project it would source the required mw power from this project and stop buying it from the tatas already after bses set up the mw dahanu power plant in maharashtra it has been buying consistently less power from the tatas say independent observers in the power industry but a senior tata executive defends the company s position our power plants have been built through world bank funding which has been guaranteed by the union government under these circumstances power would have to be evacuated till the loans are repaid we have time till when our licence expires he said but gaining control of dpc is hardly a simple issue urmik chhaya power analyst at kotak securities says any company which takes over this project will have to raise huge funds how are they going to do that the other question is where will they sell the power and what will be the payment security mechanism these are the fundamental questions that will have to be addressed before any takeover of the project can be contemplated but chhaya points out that dpc will be crucial to tata power s overall gameplan after next year how does tata power grow its power business one estimate has it that anyone wanting to take over the power project will have to pay a minimum of million assuming both companies bid at this reserve price even at an exchange rate of rs to the dollar they will have to pay rs crore this is around per cent of tata power s balance sheet size of rs crore and around per cent of bses s balance sheet size of rs crore how will these two companies raise the money says an analyst however a senior bses executive points out that the company has a low gearing with a debt equity ratio of raising rs crore at short notice is no problem at all after all what is the use of such a low debt equity ratio otherwise this executive asks tata group sources also say that raising finance is the least of their worries we are the country s largest independent power producer with an installed generation capacity of over mw we can always raise money on the strength of our balance sheet say tata group executives however a change in management control at dpc will have to be accompanied by a series of legislative changes first if the new owner is not allowed to sell power outside maharashtra the project is unlikely to make any sense for the buyer particularly as the state government has made it clear that it can absorb only mw of the proposed mw installed capacity this will mean giving the dabhol project a mega power status this is far from easy as this will need an amendment by parliament as the project was not set up through the competitive bidding route but through a memorandum of understanding the deccan chronicle monday november hc restrains centre from encashing guarantees in an ad interim order mumbai high court has restrained the centre and customs authorities from encashing guarantees undertaken by state bank of india in regard to customs duty payable by enron promoted dabhol power corporation for importing equipment to build liquified petroleum gas terminal in its dabhol plant the ex parte injunction was granted by justice d g karnik on november on a petition filed by dpc challenging the showcause notice issued by customs authorities asking the company to pay rs crore as import duty on the equipment the court also restrained the sbi to make payment under the guarantees undertaken by it on behalf of dpc the judge however allowed dpc to file an appeal before customs excise and gold appellate tribunal within a period of four weeks from the date of his order he also ruled that the ex parte injunction order shall automatically stand vacated from december subject to the orders that may be passed by the tribunal meanwhile the court directed dpc to keep the bank guarantee enforceable the financial express monday november dpc cancels houston board meet sanjay jog the enron promoted dabhol power company dpc which is yet to recover from the shock following its acquisition by dynegy last week has cancelled its board meeting scheduled for november the dpc board which consists of two directors from the maharashtra state electricity board mseb and one representing the state government was to meet on monday at houston to delegate necessary powers to the enron india managing director k wade cline for issuing a final termination notice to the mseb the dpc company secretary in a faxed communication has informed the mseb chairman vinay bansal and the state principal energy secretary vinay mohan lal that the board meeting slated for monday has been cancelled until further announcement curiously the dpc communication is silent over the reason for the cancellation of the november meeting mr bansal told the financial express on sunday i have been intimated by the dpc that november meeting has been cancelled when contacted dpc spokesman jimmy mogal declined to comment mseb which holds per cent stakes in the dabhol phase i mw in its letter of november had asked the dpc not to hold a board meeting on november in view of the mumbai high court restraining the dpc from issuing a final termination notice until further orders the high court in its judgement delivered on november over a civil suit filed by the indian financial institutions ifis has slated the next hearing on december analysts said that the dpc s decision to cancel the november meeting was quite expected as the company was aware that the situation in the wake of enron s aquisition by dynegy was fluid and it would need some time to take stock of the situation further the mumbai high court s order which gave a much needed repreive to the mseb as well as ifis came as a major setback to the dpc which had already served an asset transfer notice to the mseb on december the mseb had already communicated to the dpc that it would not be party to the dpc s decision to appoint a valuer after the issuance of asset transfer notice since it has rescinded the power purchase agreement on may following a material misrepresentation and default on the availability of power by dpc the ifis had prayed that the issuance of final termination notice by dpc to mseb would jeopardise their interest as well as investments in the distressed dabhol project the november meeting was also to take up issues related to the asset preservation the financial position of dpc relating to the phase i debt servicing safeguarding the legal position of its directors and opening of letter of credit for shipping the dpc board was quite worried especially over the upkeep of the dabhol plant which has been closed since may when mseb suspended power purchases the construction contractors have also suspended construction works on dabhol phase ii mw from june in view of dpc s inability to make their payments the dpc board would also have taken up the issue relating to the dpc s decision to pull out of the dabhol project the company which had decided to sale its stakes at billion recently expressed its desire to reduce it at around million business standard monday november blackout in the power sector a v rajwade every foreign company in the indian power sector wants to exit of these the most controversial has been enron and its dabhol power company ltd dpcl this apart the experience of investors in the reformed power sector in orissa is also unhappy five years ago orissa was the first state to adopt the world bank recommended model of separating generation transmission and distribution of power and an independent regulator the godbole committee has recently recommended the same for maharashtra as well clearly separating the three functions is a complex restructuring maybe it helps privatisation the current fashion on the subject having been set in thatcherite britain while some privatisations in uk have succeeded the experience has not been consistent all over take uk s rail sector while privatising the government in its wisdom decided to separate the ownership of the rail network railtrack and the ownership and operation of trains the contractual relationship between the various operating companies and railtrack were governed by a byzantine bewilderingly complex system of penalties and incentives to be monitored by an independent regulator such separation had no parallel besides railtrack suffered from poor management cost escalation in modernisation of tracks etc several serious accidents occurred and fixing responsibility became difficult the reform did not work and railtrack was put back under public control last month what are the chances of trifurcation of the power sector in india succeeding pretty poor if the experience of orissa is any guide it faithfully separated the three functions and privatised distribution and part of generation aes a foreign company was per cent investor in a generating company and per cent in cesco a distribution company as gajendra haldea analysed in this paper on august the policy and regulatory framework was inadequate and myopic distribution losses a euphemism for power theft were much larger than the companies had been led to believe at the time of privatisation cesco defaulted in paying the dues of gridco the transmission company which in turn defaulted to the generating company indeed all cesco s cash inflows are now escrowed leaving it no money even to pay salaries for all practical purposes the distribution companies seem to be in a difficult situation perhaps beyond redemption and the reform is a total mess the crux of the problem in the power sector is not whether a unified seb is less efficient than trifurcated companies it is the political unwillingness to charge a price which covers the cost to all consumers for a while cross subsidisation worked with commercial consumers subsidising the household and the agricultural segments however as the burden became too large the commercial sector started moving to captive generation further worsening seb finances an independent regulator for power tariffs may not solve the problem he may fix economic prices but will the state come forward to protect the bill collectors punish power thiefs face social unrest if power to recalcitrant consumers is cut off so long as the answers to these questions are in the negative as sadly they are the institutional restructuring is no substitute for substantive action no wonder all foreign investors in the power sector want to get out enron too wants out but it has many more problems in its home country over and above its dispute with mseb it had attracted a lot of adverse publicity for gouging power consumers in california a state in a power crisis see world money february the internet craze also had a hand in enron s misfortunes it became an energy trader established an electronic trading platform had broadband ambitions went into a disastrous diversification in water supplies which if i remember correctly led to rebecca mark s exit perhaps it went into too many areas too quickly under jeffery skilling ex mckinsey and was notorious for opaque complex accounts to top it all last month it announced that it will take an extraordinary billion charge in its third quarter results for losses in financial activities enron s chief financial officer who was supposed to be in charge of these has resigned amidst reports that a private equity fund associated with him was involved in them the sec is investigating the affair and enron s share price is down per cent since mid october there are some reports that shell may make a bid for enron after its ratings were downgraded enron is desperate for liquidity and anxious to dispose its assets dpcl was already on the platter now a sale has become even more urgent reportedly tatas and bses are interested so are the lending institutions clearly if a settlement is to be reached this is the optimum time but one is not very optimistic for one delhi and mumbai will be involved and bureaucracies never understand opportunity costs our byzantine decision making processes make timely decisions impossible further if a deal does take place there will be the inevitable allegations of corruption it is much safer for the reputation of the concerned ministers in mumbai and delhi to allow the drift to continue to let the law take its own course whatever the costs sadly as jairam ramesh said in this paper indian

for questions or comments regarding this report please contact g britt whitman at ex or kristin walsh at ex executive summary assembly s mou supporters mia vote stalled bailout hang ups land bonds and referendum socal up for grabs mou support waning as of last night assemblyman hertzberg reportedly had votes in favor of the bailout that he could count on there were more votes that were close and stood a reasonable chance of being cast in favor of the bailout however that still left hertzberg votes short of the he needs earlier today sen polanco the bill s sponsor privately indicated that the few remaining votes necessary to pass the amended sb xx were in place due to lobbying efforts by gov davis no doubt the count will be close but hertzberg will only take the bill up in the assembly for a vote today or tomorrow if he knows democrats can muster enough support the key issues related to getting the votes to pass sb xx are the following including the option to buy the transmission lines for some this is a philosophical issue these members are quite adamant that the option to buy the lines needs to be removed from sb xx excess profits and creditworthiness in particular how edison can use any profits the philosophy underlying the bill itself as to whether a bailout is necessary given the experience with pg e and members are skittish about voting for a bailout with the possibility of a bankruptcy still possible anyway according to assembly leadership sources no senator has asked the speaker s office for anything to be put in the bill except for a central valley senator jim costa who played a party in brokering the deal on shaver lake leadership sources were surprised by that and believe that many senators will not hold to the burton line of don t even change a period in the bill several senators including polanco and costa are vested in the bill s passage and will want to see it brought up for a vote despite significant opposition many people including polanco believe that burton may require his worker s compensation reform plan to be double joined to the edison mou in order to take it up for a vote double joining is a legislative maneuver that ties the fate of both bills together it creates a situation where both must be passed by the legislature and signed by the governor in order to go into effect if the governor only signs one neither becomes law but the governor s office has told us that burton made a direct statement to them last week that he had no intention to double join workers comp reform to sb xx some suggest that senate opposition lead by burton which remains considerable may introduce a new bailout bill if sb xx passes the assembly this new bill would be designed to be unacceptable to the assembly the senate then would pass this bill on the last day of the session and then adjourn without a conference committee the assembly would then be left to accept or reject the senate s bill without the possibility of amendments this is somewhat similar to what the senate did in july only now the recess will be until next year socal bailout barriers regarding media reports referencing assemblyman keely s deal with davis to exempt acres of the shaver lake area from the bill s conservation easements the protesters representing fresno feel that this is not good enough and they intend to pursue their lawsuit against the state regarding the easements these protestors and the republicans who represent them felt that they had achieved compromise language in the bailout last week but this language is now gone while the shaver lake amendments and all conservation easement language are again in the bill we do not believe this will significantly interfere with the bill s passage some central valley members voted in support of the bill despite the amendments and there is only one democrat dean florez who may vote against it because of them some senators also reportedly considering removing language from the bond portion of the bailout bill that makes the bonds harvey proof that is immune from a referendum by consumer advocates this language which was previously used in the california rate reduction bonds is structured such that california s credit could be compromised if the bonds are not repaid this is done by involving the california infrastructure bank as a party to the bonds some members of the senate who are in close contact with harvey rosenfield and the consumer advocates have expressed that they want to remove this language as a diplomatic way to destroy the bailout if the language is removed there is no way that the state s credit is tied to the bonds this means that the bonds can be challenged by a voter referendum without endangering the state current polls show that such a referendum which would allow voters to choose not to pay the surcharge on power bills to bail out socal would very likely succeed this would mean that the bonds could not be repaid wall street firms have stated expressly that they will not purchase the bonds if they are susceptible to a voter referendum meaning that removing the harvey proofing language will likely mean that the bailout bonds will not be able to be sold socal is also aware of this possibility if the language comes out of the bill the plan will no longer be acceptable to socal socal selling out or going under there is word in sacramento of companies sniffing around for a pre packaged purchase of edison after the bankruptcy occurs we will continue to investigate possible buyers and report when information becomes available it is also rumored that if an inadequate bill passes i e one that will not return socal to creditworthiness socal may declare voluntary bankruptcy then use whatever bailout is passed as a revenue stream in bankruptcy the only requirement laid upon socal is to attempt to go back into the market by january and there is no penalty for them failing to do so there appears to be nothing in the bailout bill that would preclude them from using money from the bailout in bankruptcy,Data Breach,Phishing,0.49765183765406756,False

hou ect ect tana jones hou ect ect james ginty corp enron enron subject re bandwidth products on enrononline revised the hardest part of preparing the long descriptions is making sure all of the terms used in th gtc s that need to be defined elsewhere are covered i ll have to leave the final determination to the people who drafted the gtc s i also have to point out i don t know much of anything about how bandwidth is traded but here are the comments i was able to come up with to the long descriptions bandwidth units this concept has been difficult for me it s not entirely clear to me where the definition of this comes from is it the reference in the box at the top of the relevant annex you are correct if so maybe we should add a line something to the effect of bandwidth units shall mean ds for this transaction or better yet you might consider a generic reference to the relevant annex that should apply which might let you delete the sentence referring to the quality as well we have changed the first sentence of the long description to read a us bandwidth transaction with enron broadband services l p ebs pursuant to which the seller shall sell and the buyer shall buy the quantity of ds bandwidth units submitted by counterparty via the website does dso need to be defined somewhere ds is a term generally known in the industry and is only used in the calculation of the contract price in the long description so we chose not to define it also the definition is incredibly long complex and technical if you feel strongly about it we can include it but since the long description tells you how many ds s you should include for calculation purposes we didn t think that it was necessary the way the different price definitions fit together has also eluded me there is a formula in the long description and a different formula in the gtc the formula in the long description differs from the formula in the gtc and in the master agreement in order to accomodate the way that the price is being quoted on enrononline the quote represents the variable component of the unit price in the gtc s and the master agreement in order not to confuse people we decided to include the formula in both the long description and the confirmation so that customers could know that the unit price was calculated using the price quoted unless industry trading convention is to the contrary the site makes more intuitive sense when the volume quoted and the price quoted use the same units if the volume is bandwidth units and the price is a per mile number some counterparties or perhaps more likely their lawyers may be confused the gtc contains the defined term unit price which is in bandwidth unit it seems to me that if we can quote the price as the unit price and the volume as bandwidth units we can ignore the number of dso s per bandwidth unit and the number of dso miles for the transaction since they won t change from one product to the next the two sentences beginning with any party entering into a transaction could be moved to the gtc since bandwidth is such a new product we really wanted to highlight to customers that if they intend to take physical delivery of bandwidth which is what we are offering they will need to establish connectivity with us this is already in the gtc but in an abundance of caution we wanted this fact highlighted especially since connectivity will entail further costs to the customer as well as signing documentation such as colocation agreements licenses etc this can be quite an involved process the term contractual currency is not used int he gtc can the parenthetical reference come out the enrononline people may care about this more than i agreed if the numbers of miles and dso s need to stay in the long descriptions i would suggest that you change the references to make it dso s per bandwidth unit both where the number is introduced and in the price formula and that the unt of measure against which the price is quoted be per dso mile per month it is a quote for one ds mile of a bandwidth unit for a month since the short description indicates the period for the contract being offered we felt like the quotation was pretty clear we are also a bit sensitive to using too many defined terms referring to each other in the long description from a commercial perspective we are comfortable that the language used in the quote and the long description are clear and accurate is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number this needs to be clear from the long description if a customer wanted to buy of the oc bandwidth units quoted for the period from july july the customer would be entitled to oc s for the period from july july i hope that this is responsive to your question we weren t entirely clear so for example if you follow all of my suggestions you might end up with something like this a us bandwidth transaction with enron broadband services l p ebs pursuant to which the seller shall sell and the buyer shall buy the quantity of bandwidth units submitted by counterparty via the website the price shall be as submitted by the counterparty via the website annex a of the general terms and conditions shall apply to this transaction the term of the transaction shall begin at a m est on the effective date and continue to p m est on the termination date the effective date is start date and the termination date is termination date the transaction shall be for bandwidth between the new york market pooling point th avenue suite new york ny npa nxx clli nycmny h and the los angeles market pooling point w th street suite los angeles ca npa nxx clli lsajcawzh the price is quoted in us dollars the unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one bandwidth unit per month and the quantity shown shall be in number of bandwidth units per month if quoting the price as a per bandwidth unit number doesn t work it would be more like this a us bandwidth transaction with enron broadband services l p ebs pursuant to which the seller shall sell and the buyer shall buy the quantity of bandwidth units submitted by counterparty via the website the number of dso s per bandwidth unit is the price shall be as submitted by the counterparty via the website annex a of the general terms and conditions will apply to this transaction the term of the transaction shall begin at a m est on the effective date and continue to p m est on the termination date the effective date is start date and the termination date is termination date the transaction shall be for bandwidth between the new york market pooling point th avenue suite new york ny npa nxx clli nycmny h and the los angeles market pooling point w th street suite los angeles ca npa nxx clli lsajcawzh for a total of dso miles the price is quoted in us dollars the unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one ds mile per month and the quantity shown shall be in number of bandwidth units per month therefore the contract price will be calculated as follows price x the number of ds s per bandwidth unit x the number of ds miles x the number of bandwidth units please let

company inc washington a top enron corp human resources executive who also served as a trustee of the company s k plan said she became aware of serious allegations about the company s financial practices in august but did nothing to protect retirement plan members speaking at a senate government affairs committee hearing cindy olson said enron vice president sherron watkins approached her for advice before sending her now well publicized e mail to former enron chairman kenneth lay in august voicing concerns about the company s accounting practices ms olson said ms watkins also sought out jeffrey mcmahon currently enron s chief operating officer who was then its treasurer for guidance at the time enron s retirement plans decimated by the collapse of the houston energy concern will come under further scrutiny in congress this week today labor secretary elaine chao testifies before the house education and workforce committee about whether retirement plan rules should change in the wake of enron s collapse tomorrow the senate committee on health education labor and pensions will hear from former enron workers in yesterday s hearing ms olson said she didn t share ms watkins s allegations with the other k plan trustees because she didn t feel it was her responsibility to repeat hearsay in addition she said ms watkins had come to her in confidence after ms watkins took her concerns to mr lay and he ordered an investigation i felt it was all in good hands ms olson said eli gottesdiener a washington based lawyer representing enron workers countered those arguments she had information that affected the lives of people and did nothing he said adding it s so clear that she breached her duty he said ms olson should have convened an emergency meeting of the trustees to inform them of ms watkins s allegations so that they could launch their own investigation the trustees immediately could have stopped offering enron stock as an investment option and stopped using enron stock as a matching contribution in the retirement plan ms olson testified that the plan trustees felt that they didn t have the ability to change the plan design without approval from the board of directors ms olson herself sold much of her own enron holdings most before she knew of ms watkins s concerns but some afterward responding to sharp questioning from lawmakers including sen joseph lieberman a connecticut democrat who heads the senate s government affairs committee ms olson acknowledged she sold enron shares for million the bulk from december to march she said she decided to sell the shares after having a falling out with former enron president jeffrey skilling over their different management styles thinking about leaving the company she said she went to a financial adviser who advised her to diversify her portfolio at his suggestion she said she put the proceeds from selling her enron shares into government bonds a few days before enron filed for bankruptcy court protection on dec ms olson said she sold an additional enron shares that were in her employee stock ownership plan for each she said she didn t have knowledge of the bankruptcy but suspected the possibility during the hearing mr lieberman said he would issue subpoenas to gather more information about the alleged payment of million in bonuses to management around the time enron filed for chapter and the company s alleged failure to pay workers severance pay beyond a one time payment as enron shares plunged last fall the company also considered postponing a planned blackout during which time employees wouldn t be able to change their investments or sell enron stock said ms olson and enron benefits manager mikie rath ms olson said she finally decided against a delay after consulting with other enron executives and an outside lawyer several days before the scheduled blackout that began on oct last year and lasted for about trading days she said the lawyer had advised enron to go ahead with the blackout on the grounds that it wouldn t be able to notify in time all employees specifically about retirees and other workers based outside of the houston headquarters about a potential postponement executives from northern trust retirement consulting llc and hewitt associates llc the companies that managed enron s k plans confirmed that they were contacted about the possibility of delaying the blackout period ms olson said enron hired counsel in early november to seek legal advice on whether it made sense to advise employees on selling their enron stockholdings this week s hearings are intended to generate more information for lawmakers who will decide whether retirement plans ought to be more carefully regulated house energy and commerce chairman w j billy tauzin r la says a top priority this year will be legislation aimed at protecting workers such as those at enron clearly we need pension reform mr tauzin the leading congressional investigator into enron said in an interview however retirement plan experts say any significant change will be an uphill battle as employer groups republicans and the bush administration oppose an overhaul in particular any limits on company stock in retirement plans somewhat less controversial are proposals by democrats and more recently by president bush and rob portman r ohio and ben cardin d md that would provide employees greater ability to diversify out of stock contributed by their employer many employers now lock workers into such shares until age or later on this issue there may be more opportunity for compromise since so far all proposals still leave employers with the freedom to lock employees into company stock for long periods mr bush s proposal has the weakest diversification provisions as it exempts many defined contribution savings plans from proposed diversification rules particularly esops which hundreds of large employers use consequently employers could continue to lock workers into company stock in many plans until age and later greg hitt contributed to this article copyright dow jones company inc all rights reserved business financial desk section a enron s many strands the overview enron executives say they debated freeze on pension by steven greenhouse and stephen labaton the new york times page column c new york times company washington feb enron executives acknowledged today that before they temporarily prevented employees from selling company stock in their retirement accounts last fall the executives had sharply debated delaying the moratorium because employees could suffer heavy losses from a plunging stock price we were concerned in the benefits department about the deterioration of the stock price mikie rath a benefits manager at enron said in testimony before the senate governmental affairs committee but after the debate on the eve of the moratorium they imposed the so called blackout period to give themselves time to replace the administrators of the retirement plan enron executives said they decided it would be too hard to notify the participants in the company s k plan immediately they also said they feared they would open themselves to lawsuits by plan participants who were notified about the delay later than others for reasons like mail delays the disclosures on the pension plan came as other congressional committees took up enron matters house and senate lawmakers issued subpoenas to compel the testimony of enron s former chief executive kenneth l lay while congressional and state officials broadened their investigations into why state pension funds and state agencies invested and did business with enron as it spiraled downward last year the senate commerce committee voted unanimously to issue the subpoena to require mr lay s appearance next tuesday a similar subpoena was issued by representative michael g oxley the ohio republican who is chairman of the house financial services committee a spokeswoman for mr lay who had been scheduled to testify on monday but bowed out said his lawyers would work out details for his appearance although lawmakers said they expected that he would invoke his fifth amendment right against self incrimination while mr lay may not answer any questions members of a house subcommittee on oversight and investigation focused on him today trying to glean by proxy what he might say under questioning william c powers chairman of the special investigative committee of enron s board that wrote a harshly critical report said that in his four hour interview with mr lay the former chairman understood that off the books partnerships were set up to hide losses but mr powers said he didn t understand or appreciate that there was anything wrong with that that s his story the accountants signed off and he was o k with that president bush brushed aside a demand by senator ernest f hollings the south carolina democrat who heads the commerce committee that a special counsel should be appointed to supervise the criminal investigation of enron mr hollings cited enron s ties to administration officials including the attorney general mr bush told reporters as he toured a research laboratory in pittsburgh this is a business problem and my justice department is going to investigate if there s wrongdoing we ll hold them accountable for mistreatment of employees and shareholders lawyers representing the employees have accused enron of stock fraud for imposing the moratorium and for not disclosing the company s financial condition resulting the lawyers say in losses of more than billion for the participants in enron s retirement plan during the moratorium employees could not sell stock in the retirement plan but senior executives faced no restrictions in selling their stock the testimony prompted a new round of criticism of enron s senior officials for looking out for their own interests while turning their backs on their employees management knew full well that their employees k s were overloaded with shares of enron said senator joseph i lieberman the connecticut democrat who is chairman of the governmental affairs committee shouldn t that have prompted them to postpone the lockdown when the company was reeling in response to the collapse of enron an administration task force is preparing recommendations to revise securities and corporate laws administration officials said that they were debating proposals to make it more likely that corporate executives and boards face personal liability for violating the law officials in connecticut one of several states considering whether to suspend or revoke the license of arthur andersen enron s accounting firm said they had subpoenaed andersen records richard blumenthal the attorney general in connecticut said he was examining a state agency s decision last year to pay enron million for an energy contract that might never be fulfilled at a house committee hearing joseph f berardino andersen s chief executive repeated earlier statements that important information about enron s finances had been withheld from his firm democrats and republicans repeatedly complained that mr berardino was evading the committee s questions about andersen s involvement in enron s collapse maybe it s better to be dumb than culpable but we want some answers said representative gary l ackerman democrat of new york your not knowing what was going on if that s the case is basically saying that you have squandered the integrity of your company mr berardino said andersen would establish new offices of audit quality and ethics and compliance before approving the subpoena of mr lay members of the senate commerce committee said that

enron stock at the senate governmental affairs hearing cindy olson enron s executive vice president for human resources said there had been a debate on the day before the trading moratorium about whether the company should postpone the blackout which was needed for a change in plan administrators but executives said they decided against delaying after concluding that it would be too hard to notify the participants in enron s k plan immediately the executives said they feared that if they delayed this blackout period they would open themselves to lawsuits by participants who were notified later than others for reasons like mail delays though the company says the blackout began oct it sent out conflicting bulletins the confusion led many employees to think that the blackout began oct when enron stock traded at by the time employees were able to sell shares on nov the shares had plunged closing at that day deborah g perrotta a former senior administrative assistant told the

price would continue to rise while some officials were raising tough questions about the stability of the company s finances ms olson who served as a trustee of enron s retirement plan testified that in august sherron s watkins an enron vice president had told her of concerns she had about whether enron executives had engaged in some chicanery that undermined the company s finances ms watkins

before and immediately after the collapse of the giant texas energy trading company their stories were very different deborah g perrotta an administrative assistant broke down in tears as she described losing her job in retirement savings and all but a fraction of her severance pay the other cindy olson executive vice president of enron s human resources department and one of the people in charge of the company s ill fated k plan still works for enron she matter of factly described how a year ago when enron stock was near its peak she cashed in options on shares netting about million their testimony again highlighted the devastation that can befall employees who tie their jobs and their retirement security to a single company but it also showed how much difference professional advice and investment instincts can make for workers in a situation like enron s and how workers caught up in a company s collapse can be affected very differently perrotta and olson testified before the senate governmental affairs committee which is trying to determine what changes might be needed in federal pension and employment laws to improve worker protections should their employer fail the hearing highlighted several issues that are common in k and other retirement savings plans known as defined contribution plans which unlike old fashioned defined benefit pensions place the market risk and reward on employees fiduciary responsibility who is responsible for sharing information with employees and retirees and how and when former enron chairman kenneth l lay encouraged workers to keep their retirement money in company stock perrotta recalled that in august she was awarded a block of shares and an accompanying e mail from lay said that one of my highest priorities is to restore investor confidence in enron this should result in a significantly higher stock price i hope this grant lets you know how valued you are to enron olson however had a higher position at the company and access to more information than perrotta indeed olson actually spoke with whistle blower sherron watkins before watkins sent her anonymous letter to lay in which she said she worried that the company s accounting practices could lead to a major scandal olson said watkins was fearful that she was overlooking something or that there was some other reason her conclusions might be incorrect olson took no action to inform other employees about the concerns however she went to speak to mr lay and mr lay kicked off an investigation olson said i felt like it was in good hands how tough it is to separate loyalty from investment decisions enron s restrictions on employees selling stock they received as matching contributions to their k plans have been well chronicled but by some accounts percent of the enron stock in the plan was there because workers invested in it voluntarily olson however had been granted options that did not have the same restrictions against selling as the enron stock matches in the k plan olson said she cashed in her options only because she had a run in with then chief executive jeffrey skilling that motivated her to seek professional investment advice the adviser told her she was too emotionally involved with the stock and she agreed to sell olson said she held on to another shares in her retirement account until two days before the company went into bankruptcy the panel is looking at proposals to limit the percentage of company stock permitted in a k account but employer groups argue that retirement plans are often designed to align the interests of workers and companies and they are urging congress to be careful not to discourage companies from offering retirement plans or matching worker contributions to plans investment advice most companies are reluctant to provide it for fear of exposing themselves to liability if the advice doesn t work out pending legislation would permit them to provide advice or to pay for it from third parties the potential benefits for employees seem clear in retrospect olson went to an adviser while perrotta did not when it started to fall apart we just sat there watched it perrotta said but critics say that the issue is more complex than it seems and that any legislation should be careful to eliminate conflicts of interest among advisers and employers lockdowns of k plans these freezes on account activity occur when a company changes plan administrators and can last up to several months enron changed administrators last fall and employee accounts were frozen for several weeks the exact duration is in dispute severance in bankruptcy laid off workers are generally limited to payments of about severance owed beyond that is usually treated as a general unsecured debt though some courts have been more lenient it has become routine however for companies entering bankruptcy to pay large retention bonuses to keep certain workers while the newly unemployed get little enron paid out million in such bonuses enron benefits manager mikie rath who testified with olson drew snickers in the crowded hearing room when she said she had gotten a retention bonus but could not remember exactly how much it was pressed she said it was about enron workers who were laid off would have been entitled to about million total and olson said we thought we could give employees the full severance but at the th hour we found we could only give company lawyers said the limit was set by law she said copyright dow jones company inc all rights reserved execs say they tried to protect workers money by patty reinert copyright houston chronicle washington bureau feb pm washington two enron executives told a senate panel tuesday that they scrambled to protect employees retirement savings and severance pay as soon as they realized the company was collapsing last year we did the best we could with a difficult situation said cindy olson executive vice president for human resources for the houston energy trader olson and enron benefits manager mikie rath told members of the senate governmental affairs committee that they had considered then rejected putting off a planned change in the company s investment administrator last fall when they realized the transition would take place as enron s stock was falling employees were prevented from selling the stock in their k retirement accounts during the transition later as the company was headed for bankruptcy olson said she had several conversations with then chairman ken lay to try to salvage employees severance pay she quickly concluded she said that employees would get only a nominal payment of each if enron declared bankruptcy the realization was devastating she said several former enron workers who are suing olson and other top executives criticized the executives testimony debbie perrotta a laid off senior administrative assistant who had worked at enron for five years testified tuesday that houston enron employees lost their jobs their retirement savings and an estimated million in severance and vacation pay after the company filed for bankruptcy on dec but two days before that filing perrotta said enron cut million in retention bonuses for a small number of executives sen joseph lieberman d conn who heads the senate committee said he would subpoena records on the retention bonuses perrotta broke down and cried several times as she told of losing in retirement money and struggling to pay for her family s health care and her daughter s wedding she said she and other laid off employees now must wait in line behind enron s creditors in bankruptcy court to recover whatever they can it may be the law she said but it s wrong lieberman asked olson to explain why she failed to warn employees to sell their enron stock as the price was sliding we didn t have a crystal ball olson said we didn t know where the stock was going to go she added that federal law limits what investment advice employers can give their employees besides she said the company s top executives put their faith in lay and hoped he could save the company but lieberman pointed out that something must have motivated olson to sell million of her own enron stock months earlier olson who served on enron s executive committee from until she and then chief executive officer jeff skilling had a falling out and he removed her in early said she sold most of her company stock in late and early olson said she was thinking of leaving enron after skilling demoted her from the executive committee and took away some of her human resources duties she said she and skilling did not see eye to eye about how employees should be treated olson said she and her husband hired their own financial adviser who urged her to diversify her stock portfolio so she would not be so reliant on her company s stock olson also testified that sherron watkins a former enron executive had come to her last summer asking olson s advice on whether she should approach lay with concerns about accounting problems she believed threatened to bring down the company olson said watkins was unsure whether a memo she had written to lay on aug was technically or legally accurate olson said she encouraged watkins to talk to lay even after her conversation with watkins however olson said she did not warn her colleagues her talk with watkins had been confidential she said and she trusted lay to act if watkins fears were on target both olson and rath told lawmakers that they had considered halting the transition to a new retirement fund administrator last fall but concluded that it would take longer to stop the process than to go through with it in the midst of last fall s anthrax scares and the resulting delays in mail service they said it would have been impossible to notify the retirees invested in enron s retirement plan if the company had decided to change the schedule for the transition notifying current enron employees via e mail would have treated current and former enron employees differently and that would have been unfair they said instead they decided to speed up the transition process and were able to shave one week off of the lockdown period so that employees would have access to their accounts sooner they said at the time rath testified she was still hoping the stock price would go back up in the hallway outside the hearing later several laid off workers criticized the two executives testimony she cashed out six and a half million dollars in her own enron stock gwen gray said of olson she knew the company was failing gray who also worked in enron s human resources department before she was laid off said she was disturbed by rath s remark that she couldn t remember the amount of her own retention bonus when rath s former colleagues in the audience laughed at her statement senators pressured rath she said the bonus was in excess of olson testified that she had

committees in the senate and house yesterday subpoenaed lay to appear on capitol hill on feb and lay who withdrew from a scheduled appearance monday is expected to invoke his constitutional right

their wrath on arthur andersen chief executive joseph f berardino blasting the big accounting firm s audits of enron and voicing exasperation when berardino said he didn t know the answers to many of their questions about andersen s conduct maybe it s better to be dumb than culpable but we want some answers said rep gary l ackerman d n y i mean your ship is going to go down and you re going to be lashed to the mast unless you start talking to us about what happened berardino who headed andersen s audit practice before becoming its chief executive about a year ago said andersen was still trying to gather the facts i don t know with authority what we knew and when we knew it he told the financial services subcommittee on capital markets one of several congressional panels investigating enron s collapse separately a spokesman for andersen said yesterday that its auditors went to enron s board earlier than was previously known with concerns about possible illegal activity the first approach was in august after the emergence of a letter from executive sherron watkins to lay warning of widespread accounting irregularities spokesman charlie leonard said federal law requires auditors to alert the sec when they suspect illegality and the board or management does not address it in this case andersen personnel went to the board but not to the sec because they were assured the board was investigating the matter leonard said andersen previously said it had alerted the board to possible illegal activities last fall as enron unraveled as lawmakers search for ways to prevent future enrons rep richard h baker r la chairman of the house subcommittee floated what would be a fundamental change in the auditing business having stock exchanges hire the auditors currently auditors are

campaign and has ties to a number of administration officials the house energy and commerce committee yesterday subpoenaed former enron chief financial officer andrew s fastow to appear at a hearing tomorrow fastow s attorneys originally told the committee he would appear voluntarily but they later informed the committee he had a change of heart committee spokesman ken johnson said fastow who organized some of enron s largest partnerships and earned at least million from running them intends to assert his fifth amendment right against self incrimination johnson said but he will be required to do that in front of the committee fastow has hired criminal lawyer john keker of san francisco who prosecuted oliver l north in the iran contra affair to represent him in the justice department s criminal investigation andersen s chief executive yesterday made his second voluntary appearance before the capital markets subcommittee and lawmakers praised him for testifying but that was one of the few things they gave him credit for during about four hours of stern questioning and speechifying it was a much more skeptical reception than berardino received from the same lawmakers in december when he faced few if any probing questions that appearance however took place before andersen acknowledged that it had destroyed numerous documents pertaining to its work at enron and before the powers report said it did not fulfill its professional responsibilities in its enron work berardino said auditing is a hard job and andersen personnel are trained to do the right thing but we are human beings and we may not get it right every time i m not apologizing for that he said rep max sandlin d tex asked berardino to consider the people whose lives you helped destroy a reference to enron employees who lost their jobs and the bulk of their retirement savings when enron collapsed rep michael e capuano d mass said andersen blew it so badly the report commissioned by enron directors accused andersen of failing in its responsibilities and helping enron create a web of transactions designed to hide debts and losses in the process the report said andersen accountants had to surmount numerous obstacles presented by pertinent accounting rules for example the report said andersen advised enron each step of the way about transactions with a group of off the books partnerships known as the raptors which had little economic substance the raptor transactions accounted for about billion of the billion of pretax income enron reported during the five quarters that preceded enron s december bankruptcy filing berardino said andersen approved deals involving the partnerships but didn t come up with the ideas for them the accounting firm was reacting to plans developed by enron personnel investment bankers and others he said suffice it to say that we were very much involved as the company was setting up these transactions giving our advice on whether they would pass the rules berardino said that was part of andersen s job as auditor he said the point i would like to emphasize is at the end of the day these are the company s financial statements berardino told the committee we cannot make a company report any more than what the rules require he said berardino called for a major overhaul of accounting and auditing saying that simply tinkering with the system would fail to prevent further financial debacles he said stronger discipline is needed because today punishment is not sufficiently certain to promote confidence in the profession the andersen chief said auditors should rate the quality of a company s accounting instead of just issuing a pass or fail grade as they now do he told lawmakers that andersen will no longer serve as both internal and outside auditor for the same company as it did at enron and will stop consulting to audit clients on the design and implementation of their financial information systems berardino said such activities accounted for very very little of the million andersen received from enron in some lawmakers called on berardino to stop consulting to audit clients altogether meanwhile deloitte touche tohmatsu the

washington enron corp executives tried to get one of the company s in house lawyers fired in after their boss expressed unhappiness with the way the lawyer was negotiating with a partnership in which the boss had an interest congressional investigators said the disclosure underlined the conflicts of interest that apparently existed with outside partnerships set up and run by some enron executives for enron which is now in bankruptcy proceedings the partnerships allowed the houston energy trading company to enhance its profits and to move debt off its books but the partnerships also were used by some senior enron executives to enrich themselves according to an internal company report released this weekend the investigators statements came as several congressional committees pushed forward with probes into enron s collapse a house and senate panel each voted to issue subpoenas to force appearances by kenneth lay enron s former chairman and chief executive meanwhile the head of arthur andersen enron s former auditor was aggressively questioned before a house panel and outlined additional steps the accounting firm is taking to restore its reputation at issue in the case involving the enron lawyer was one of the outside partnerships known as ljm enron attorney joel ephros was negotiating with attorneys for ljm from the law firm of kirkland ellis in when he received an expletive laced angry voice mail about his handling of the negotiation from enron s chief financial officer andrew fastow according to an account given to congressional investigators mr fastow at the time ran and had an ownership interest in ljm which eventually earned him substantial profits later in the fall of two of mr fastow s subordinates ben glisan jr and michael kopper approached mr ephros s boss to accuse the lawyer of being unresponsive and incompetent and to urge his dismissal the boss jordan mintz general counsel of enron global finance had just started his new job and said he wasn t prepared to make any personnel moves so he declined informed of the decision mr fastow didn t object mr mintz later decided to keep mr ephros on staff and praised his performance the attempt to fire mr ephros will be aired at a hearing tomorrow before the house energy and commerce committee s oversight panel billy tauzin chairman of the full committee said in an interview the louisiana republican offered the episode as an example of what he called a corrupt culture within enron as it sought to inflate revenue and conceal losses using entities such as ljm they literally became sham operations said mr tauzin who is leading the most aggressive probe of nearly a dozen now being conducted on capitol hill into enron one purpose was to fool investors into believing that debt had moved that risk had moved and the other purpose was to create phony income this is an old game this is nothing new this is insider theft mr mintz will be a chief witness at tomorrow s hearing and is expected to detail his recollections about the effort made to muzzle mr ephros a spokesman for mr fastow declined to comment a lawyer for mr glisan didn t return a call for comment mr ephros and mr kopper couldn t be reached mr tauzin said he expects messrs fastow and kopper to invoke their fifth amendment rights against possible self incrimination to avoid testifying at tomorrow s hearing the ephros episode is an example of a problem addressed cryptically in the internal report by a special committee of enron s board that was released last weekend mr fastow was in a position to exert great pressure and influence we have been told of instances in which he used that pressure to try to obtain better terms for ljm the report said simply put there was little of the separation and independence required to enable enron employees to negotiate effectively against ljm mr tauzin said that tomorrow s hearing will also feature details of what he called literally a sweetheart deal involving another partnership according to mr tauzin and his investigators one of the partnership deals was cut by two enron employees who were engaged to be married one representing enron and one representing ljm congressional investigators said that the agreement netted huge profits for the couple trushar patel an enron attorney and his fiancee anne c yaeger who worked with mr fastow and later left enron ms yaeger signed a million agreement on behalf of ljm listing herself as an authorized person documents shows her husband signed representing enron committee spokesman ken johnson said investigators have learned ms yaeger entered into the transaction by initially providing just as a down payment later kicking in an additional we believe she walked away from the deal with a profit of half a million dollars mr johnson said that s not a bad return for a initial investment messages left at the home of the couple weren t returned in other action the senate commerce committee and the house financial services committee approved subpoenas for mr lay to appear before their panels on feb and respectively mr lay had agreed to appear at hearings this week but backed out in response to scathing criticism from capitol hill prompted by revelations in the enron board s internal report though he will be forced to appear he can refuse to testify by invoking the fifth amendment and several senators and house members predicted he would do so kelly kimberly mr lay s spokeswoman said he and his lawyers haven t yet decided whether he will testify in his second appearance before the house financial services panel andersen ceo joseph berardino outlined new steps the accounting firm will take to restore confidence in its work including creating offices for audit quality ethics and compliance mr berardino came under heavy criticism from panel members for andersen s role in the enron affair including a document destruction effort undertaken by houston based employees one of whom was subsequently fired he said he was embarrassed by the shredding on andersen s role in reviewing questionable partnership transactions which later led to enron s collapse he reiterated his assertion that information was withheld by enron as andersen was reviewing them the difficulty mr berardino faces in restoring confidence in his company was made clear in connecticut yesterday as the state s board of accountancy escalated its investigation of the firm issuing a subpoena for enron related documents the state could revoke andersen s license to practice in connecticut and levy a fine state attorney general

simply out of his element among the intricacies of the retail market colleagues said and his spokesman gordon andrew acknowledged yet while enron was notorious for its cutthroat corporate culture its succeed or leave ethic mr fastow had enough influence to return to his old department finance what the guy knew was numbers and finance a longtime colleague said he knew how to close a deal no one did that better than andy today investigators think that mr fastow s financial wizardry his ability to wrap the company s assets and debts into complicated off balance sheet deals was a central cause of enron s undoing what mr fastow presented as an arrangement intended to benefit enron according to a report released on saturday by a special committee of the board became over time a means of enriching himself personally and facilitating manipulation of enron s financial statements no one yet knows how much of the blame for enron s collapse should fall upon mr fastow on thursday mr fastow a father of two who was enron s chief financial officer until he was forced to resign in october is expected to invoke his fifth amendment right rather than give potentially self incriminating answers to questions from members of congress the crucial question is whether mr fastow was the mastermind behind enron s most suspect financing deals or was he as mr fastow has maintained through a spokesman merely doing with the board s knowledge the bidding of his superiors at enron the former chief executives kenneth l lay and jeffrey k skilling even before mr fastow s appearance on capitol hill representative james c greenwood republican of pennsylvania called him the betty crocker of cooked books and today in one congressional hearing william c powers jr an enron director who led the committee that wrote the internal report said mr fastow had been plagued by dual loyalties fastow couldn t mind the store mr powers said because he was involved in the transactions for now mr fastow is not telling his story he declined to be interviewed for this article and he refused to cooperate with a special investigative committee for enron s board he also invoked his right against self incrimination at a meeting a few weeks ago with the securities and exchange commission but the portrait that is emerging of mr fastow from interviews with former colleagues and details from the enron special report is that of a brilliant ambitious and hard charging executive who it appears grew obsessed with using complex financing techniques to supercharge enron s earnings while inflating his own paycheck besides the million he made in the ljm partnerships mr fastow earned a hefty salary and stock options at enron in and he sold about million in enron stock it was not as if he needed the money his friends say his wife the former lea weingarten is the heiress to a houston real estate fortune but mr fastow was adamant friends say in his belief that the amount of money a person made was the only meaningful measure of success in business even after mr fastow retreated into seclusion last fall he continued building an square foot house in houston s wealthy river oaks neighborhood the fastows also maintain an art collection some of which has been displayed at the contemporary arts museum and at the menil collection both in houston he also had a prominent role in houston s jewish community taking charge of fund raising for the city s new holocaust museum the work was significantly greater than the reward said bobby lapin a lawyer who has known mr fastow for years the person i know bears absolutely no relation to the person who has been characterized in some reports within the walls of enron but the focus on capitol hill is not on good deeds according to the internal report mr fastow and a group of other top executives secretly invested in a series of partnerships that benefited from swapping assets with enron mr fastow used some of those partnerships to conceal losses at enron he used others to inflate profits by about billion in a month period in and and in one instance he invested in southampton place a partnership that in a matter of two months made million from a deal with enron the special report said that transaction and many others were never disclosed to enron s directors the report said the million would eventually reach mr fastow through a family foundation he had set up as a charity the collapse of enron is a dramatic reversal of fortune for mr fastow until last august when mr skilling resigned as chief executive mr fastow was at his side constantly a crucial player in winning enron acclaim as one of the world s most innovative companies he arrived at the company in at age a handsome talented and ambitious man who would eventually assume the job of chief financial officer in at the age of a graduate of tufts university and the kellogg school of management at northwestern mr fastow was helping to refashion a gas pipeline company into something more akin to a wall street trading house those who knew mr fastow at enron described a man with twin personalities they say he could be charming yet aggressive quiet yet mercurial and philanthropic yet bent on accumulating the trappings of wealth he was very smart and very good at what he did one former executive said he could be nice but he could also be quite volatile and short tempered he didn t have a lot of patience with people who weren t as smart as him andrew stuart fastow was born in washington but grew up in new providence n j the son of a buyer for supermarkets and department stores his career started in chicago in the s at continental bank where he worked on troubled loans and more complicated deals like leveraged buyouts at enron he started by trying to arrange financing for mr skilling s innovative plan the creation of a gas bank that would help struggling energy companies by providing them with loans in exchange for their oil and gas reserves which enron could hedge and trade against in its growing derivatives unit enron later began supporting energy producers by creating partnerships that allowed the company to keep the debt off the balance sheet the first of those partnerships was named cactus by the partnerships mr fastow helped set up were so successful that calpers the california public employees retirement system approached enron about a joint venture the partnership was called jedi or the joint energy development investments later there were hundreds of other partnerships with names like obi chewco and raptor in recent years as enron pushed to build power plants and to develop new markets the company needed huge amounts of capital and partnerships were one way to pay for the projects without having the debt accumulate on enron s balance sheet in cfo magazine honored mr fastow for creating an innovative financing structure in a rare interview he told cfo that he would use off balance sheet transactions to avoid weakening enron s credit rating and he would do this while operating in the shadows this guy was never anything but low profile said john e olson an energy analyst at sanders morris harris he rarely if ever showed up at analyst meetings he was a loan consolidator by there were small fissures in mr fastow s labyrinthine financing empire as early as enron had difficulty finding a partner to buy out calpers s interest so apparently to skirt disclosure rules mr fastow proposed listing his wife s family as outside investors when he was rebuffed michael kopper who worked under mr fastow at enron was selected because he was a lower level employee enron would not have to disclose his interest in s e c filings mr kopper would eventually make at least million in profit from the venture later mr fastow dealt with partnerships that involved at least four other enron employees mr fastow the board report said often played dual roles as an enron executive and a partner of ljm once he found

government reform subcommittee on oversight and investigations lay s story was that the accountants had signed off on it powers said it was a credible device powers also disclosed that the enron board s investigative committee spent a couple of hours interviewing former enron vice chairman j clifford baxter who was found dead on jan of a self inflicted gunshot wound powers said baxter gave no hint that he was a person in danger house members asked powers for notes or recordings from that interview powers said he could not turn the records over without permission from the company but he said he would support their release enron attorney robert bennett later said the company certainly will provide the materials requested committees in the senate and house yesterday subpoenaed lay to appear on capitol hill on feb and lay who withdrew from a scheduled appearance monday is expected to invoke his constitutional right against self incrimination and refuse to testify but the subpoenas mean he will have to do so in person in the full glare of publicity meanwhile members of a financial services subcommittee unleashed their wrath on arthur andersen chief executive joseph f berardino blasting the big accounting firm s audits of enron and voicing exasperation when berardino said he didn t know the answers to many of their questions about andersen s conduct maybe it s better to be dumb than culpable but we want some answers said rep gary l ackerman d n y i mean your ship is going to go down and you re going to be lashed to the mast unless you start talking to us about what happened berardino who headed andersen s audit practice before becoming its chief executive about a year ago said andersen was still trying to gather the facts i don t know with authority what we knew and when we knew it he told the financial services subcommittee on capital markets one of several congressional panels investigating enron s collapse separately a spokesman for andersen said yesterday that its auditors went to enron s board earlier than was previously known with concerns about possible illegal activity the first approach was in august after the emergence of a letter from executive sherron watkins to lay warning of widespread accounting irregularities spokesman charlie leonard said federal law requires auditors to alert the sec when they suspect illegality and the board or management does not address it in this case andersen personnel went to the board but not to the sec because they were assured the board was investigating the matter leonard said andersen previously said it had alerted the board to possible illegal activities last fall as enron unraveled as lawmakers search for ways to prevent future enrons rep richard h baker r la chairman of the house subcommittee floated what would be a fundamental change in the auditing business having stock exchanges hire the auditors currently auditors are hired by the companies they are responsible for auditing an arrangement that some lawmakers say deters them from challenging dubious corporate accounting in other developments yesterday president bush rejected a call by sen ernest f hollings d s c for a special prosecutor to investigate enron saying his justice department could do the job enron was a major contributor to the bush presidential campaign and has ties to a number of administration officials the house energy and commerce committee yesterday subpoenaed former enron chief financial officer andrew s fastow to appear at a hearing tomorrow fastow s attorneys originally told the committee he would appear voluntarily but they later informed the committee he had a change of heart committee spokesman ken johnson said fastow who organized some of enron s largest partnerships and earned at least million from running them intends to assert his fifth amendment right against self incrimination johnson said but he will be required to do that in front of the committee fastow has hired criminal lawyer john keker of san francisco who prosecuted oliver l north in the iran contra affair to represent him in the justice department s criminal investigation andersen s chief executive yesterday made his second voluntary appearance before the capital markets subcommittee and lawmakers praised him for testifying but that was one of the few things they gave him credit for during about four hours of stern questioning and speechifying it was a much more skeptical reception than berardino received from the same lawmakers in december when he faced few if any probing questions that appearance however took place before andersen acknowledged that it had destroyed numerous documents pertaining to its work at enron and before the powers report said it did not fulfill its professional responsibilities in its enron work berardino said auditing is a hard job and andersen personnel are trained to do the right thing but we are human beings and we may not get it right every time i m not apologizing for that he said rep max sandlin d tex asked berardino to consider the people whose lives you helped destroy a reference to enron employees who lost their jobs and the bulk of their retirement savings when enron collapsed rep michael e capuano d mass said andersen blew it so badly the report commissioned by enron directors accused andersen of failing in its responsibilities and helping enron create a web of transactions designed to hide debts and losses in the process the report said andersen accountants had to surmount numerous obstacles presented by pertinent accounting rules for example the report said andersen advised enron each step of the way about transactions with a group of off the books partnerships known as the raptors which had little economic substance the raptor transactions accounted for about billion of the billion of pretax income enron reported during the five quarters that preceded enron s december bankruptcy filing berardino said andersen approved deals involving the partnerships but didn t come up with the ideas for them the accounting firm was reacting to plans developed by enron personnel investment bankers and others he said suffice it to say that we were very much involved as the company was setting up these transactions giving our advice on whether they would pass the rules berardino said that was part of andersen s job as auditor he said the point i would like to emphasize is at the end of the day these are the company s financial statements berardino told the committee we cannot make a company report any more than what the rules require he said berardino called for a major overhaul of accounting and auditing saying that simply tinkering with the system would fail to prevent further financial debacles he said stronger discipline is needed because today punishment is not sufficiently certain to promote confidence in the profession the andersen chief said auditors should rate the quality of a company s accounting instead of just issuing a pass or fail grade as they now do he told lawmakers that andersen will no longer serve as both internal and outside auditor for the same company as it did at enron and will stop consulting to audit clients on the design and implementation of their financial information systems berardino said such activities accounted for very very little of the million andersen received from enron in some lawmakers called on berardino to stop consulting to audit clients altogether meanwhile deloitte touche tohmatsu the global parent of accounting firm deloitte touche said it will announce today that it

state by state lobbying by enron s political teams but pai wasn t through and ees shifted its sights to large commercial and industrial customers while spinning off its power marketing operation for households to a new subsidiary called new power co in one interview in skilling called pai my icbm an intellectual missile instantly launched at new ventures he can conceptualize it bring in the right

growing inside the company that losses racked up by a group of obscure partnerships could spill into public view records show the huge investment losses by the four so called raptor partnerships were disclosed months later and played a key role in forcing enron in october to say it had overstated the value of the company by billion spurring the company s filing for chapter bankruptcy protection dec stock sales by enron executives before the company s descent previously have come under a spotlight but the timing of the sales gained new significance with the release saturday of an internal enron investigation that detailed the executives knowledge of the raptor problems four enron executives including former president and chief executive jeffrey k skilling and former chief financial officer andrew s fastow sold about million in stock from aug when the raptor problems became known internally through march when the partnerships were restructured to prevent disclosure of losses according to a review of stock sales tuesday there is no evidence that the sales were directly related to knowledge of the problems facing the raptors but any stock sales by executives based on information not available to the public could be construed as trading on inside information a federal crime according to a washington securities lawyer who declined to speak for attribution the executives skilling fastow and chief accounting officer richard a causey and chief risk officer richard b buy could not be reached for comment during the period aug to march skilling had stock sales totaling million and fastow sales totaling million according to data compiled by thomson financial a securities research firm causey s sales totaled million and buy s totaled million thomson said the sales came at a time when enron executives were concerned that losses by the raptors could force damaging public disclosure the fear of disclosing those losses led enron to expand and restructure the raptors during an eight month period in to keep its losses off the corporate books according to an enron board committee s internal report issued saturday only an elaborate reorganization of the raptors last march saved enron from having to disclose a million loss on its first quarter financial statements according to enron s internal report starting april enron created the first of four raptor entities so that losses in its investment portfolio including stocks would not show up on enron s income statement the internal report said the raptors which were little known beyond a small group of corporate insiders allowed the energy company to hedge or shield itself from future losses on its investment portfolio by shifting some of the risk to the raptors enron provided the initial funding for three of the raptors with shares of its own stock each one also received a modest investment from a related partnership headed by fastow in essence the raptors agreed to cover potential losses on certain enron investments as long as the value of the enron shares backing the raptors held up the entities would be able to pay their debts to the energy giant enron counted the debts owed by the raptors as income offsetting losses from its portfolio soon after creating the raptors however enron executives learned how quickly they could slip into trouble according to the report skilling fastow causey and buy attended an aug meeting of enron s finance committee in which treasurer ben glisan noted that the credit capacity of raptor i was almost completely utilized and that raptor ii would not be available until months later the committee recommended creating a raptor iv but before that could be activated executives created without board approval raptor iii without informing the board unlike the other entities raptor iii was not backed by enron stock making it what the internal investigation called an extraordinarily fragile structure one day after raptor iii became active on sept causey exercised stock options and sold an additional shares netting million according to the analysis by thomson that was one of only four days enron s chief accounting officer has traded shares according to thomson by late two of the entities raptor i and raptor iii were essentially insolvent lacking the credit to be able to pay back their debts the report said raptor iii was in especially bad shape unlike the three other entities raptor iii was essentially backed by shares of new power co an enron spinoff that quickly foundered after going public but under the deal designed by enron accountants the more that new power shares fell the more money raptor iii owed enron new power went public oct by mid november the stock had lost of its value threatening to wreak havoc with the raptor structure and force enron to disclose huge losses according to the internal report on nov fastow sold shares at each for a gross of million filings reviewed by thomson did not indicate fastow s cost so his net gain on the sales is unclear stock sales by fastow earlier in the year after the raptors had been devised but before they showed signs of serious trouble netted him an estimated million to avoid having to disclose a huge loss enron executives on dec merged the credit of the four raptors under a day pact allowing enron to avoid reporting a credit reserve loss in its year end financial statements in early january enron accountants began work to develop a more permanent solution to replace the day agreement according to the internal report the accountants designed a complex restructuring that took effect march we were told that during the first quarter of skilling said that fixing the raptors credit capacity problems was one of the company s highest priorities the report said skilling has disputed that account he told the board investigation team led by texas law school dean william powers that he recalls being informed of the raptors credit problems in only general terms and that he understood the matter to be an accounting issue the committee found that either skilling was not nearly as involved in enron s business as his reputation and his own description of his approach to the job would suggest or he was deliberately kept in the dark by those involved in the restructuring by february enron accountants were providing daily reports of the credit status of at least two of the raptors to causey and buy according to the internal report tension built through march according to the report after executives became aware that enron would have to take a pretax charge against earnings of about million to reflect the shortfall in credit capacity of raptors i and iii buy who had not traded any enron shares since becoming enron s chief risk officer in mid began an intense sell off jan according to thomson s analysis the shares he sold from that date through march of that year are the only shares he has sold since taking that post the sales netted him an estimated million for his part enron s since ousted chairman and chief executive kenneth l lay knew of the creation of the raptors the internal report said but investigators said they found no evidence that lay who stepped aside as ceo in february in favor of skilling was aware of the entities debts and reorganization on aug lay exercised options and sold shares netting a million profit on the day on nov he settled into a pattern selling blocks of to shares almost every day until august in hindsight the committee said enron s top executives as well as outside advisors including accounting firm andersen should have kept closer oversight ofthe raptors and other partnerships the creation and especially the subsequent restructuring of the raptors was perceived by many within enron as a triumph of accounting ingenuity by a group of innovative accountants the committee report said we believe especially after the restructuring the raptors were little more than a highly

sharply criticized in a report by a special committee of the board are expected to leave the company members of the senior staff at enron have been told that richard a causey the chief accounting officer and richard b buy the chief risk officer are expected to leave the company and are currently negotiating the terms of their departures the situation is in flux according to people close to the board while the report examined the role of other executives who remain at enron including jeffrey mcmahon enron s new president and james v derrick jr the general counsel it focused on the responsibilities of mr causey and mr buy in providing accounting and risk management controls at enron an enron spokesman and a lawyer for mr causey and mr buy did not return phone calls seeking comment none of the four executives had a direct role in the arrangement outlined in the report that used the partnerships to inflate profits and enrich some employees but none of the executives alerted the board to troubling signs that these partnerships posed problems according to the report mr causey mr buy and mr derrick were all broadly responsible for overseeing what the company told investors about the partnerships and they all played a part in the general oversight of enron s finances mr derrick s lawyer j clifford gunter said mr derrick could not comment on the report but the two executives with explicit duties to oversee the partnerships reviewing transactions between the partnerships and the company were mr causey and mr buy while the report says they did not ignore their duties they interpreted their roles very narrowly and did not give the transactions the degree of review the board believed was occurring as the most senior accounting officer mr causey was ultimately responsible for enron s financial reporting according to the report he presided over and participated in a series of accounting judgments that based on the accounting advice we have received went well beyond the aggressive said the report mr causey also had a significant role in the decisions surrounding what enron would make public according to the report although the report depicted him as relying on the advice of the company s outside accountant arthur andersen he was described as the final arbiter of unresolved differences among the various contributors to the financial reporting process the report concluded that enron s disclosures involving the compensation of the former chief financial officer involved in the partnerships and a variety of transactions between the partnerships and the company were fundamentally inadequate because of mr causey s specific responsibility with reviewing enron s transactions with the ljm partnerships he should have been in a position to provide advice concerning the disclosures according to the report the evidence we have seen suggests he did not the report criticized mr buy for neglecting his role in reviewing and approving all of the transactions between the partnerships and enron mr buy never followed a procedure to identify all the transactions and did not in the report s words affirmatively carry out his responsibility for carefully reviewing the economic terms of all of the transactions the wall street journal reported yesterday that both mr causey and mr buy were being placed on leave the board s report provides less detail on the role of mr derrick enron s general counsel who oversaw the dozens of in house lawyers involved the report does however suggest that mr derrick and enron s in house legal staff played some role in determining what enron told the public in conjunction with the company s outside accountants and lawyers mr derrick was also at the center of enron s investigation of the concerns raised by sherron s watkins an enron executive last august according to the report in consultation with kenneth l lay enron s chairman he selected vinson elkins despite potential conflicts as the law firm to conduct the preliminary inquiry and severely limited its range the scope and process of the investigation appear to have been structured with less skepticism than was needed to see through these particularly complex transactions the report said even mr mcmahon who was named enron s president last month as part of the team now leading enron s restructuring appears to be among the many executives who failed to speak up according to the report while mr mcmahon raised doubts about the partnerships as early as march according to the report he appears never to have voiced them to mr lay or the board all four executives were named in a lawsuit concerning possible insider trading because of their sales of enron stock in recent years according to the lawsuit mr causey sold million in stock mr derrick sold million mr buy sold million and mr mcmahon sold million mr derrick never exercised a single option that was not about to expire according to his lawyer in the end the report highlights what appear to be a series of failures of the various checks in place that led to billion in false profits and the crisis in confidence that culminated in enron s filing for bankruptcy last fall at any point concerns raised by the legal accounting or risk management executives involved might have prevented the company s collapse according to robert mittelstaedt jr a

of the largest bankruptcy case in american history congressional leaders and staff members said today the extension of the congressional inquiries is a mixed blessing for the white house because the enron examination on capitol hill will continue to be a distraction from the bush administration s war on terrorism and its efforts to invigorate the economy congressional staff members say the enron

more than it hurts us ken johnson spokesman for the house committee on energy and commerce said of the delay in hearing from the former executives the game plan was always to bring in the underlings first and set the stage for an appearance by mr lay and the other senior executives when we have more evidence in as a house panel inquiry on the tobacco industry was just beginning seven tobacco executives voluntarily testified and swore under oath that nicotine was not addictive and they did not market cigarettes to children later in the inquiry the panel obtained a slew of documents that undercut many of the statements made by the tobacco executives but when republicans seized the leadership of the house in the executives were not required to testify again after the republicans closed the inquiry mr lay s refusal to testify served as a reminder on capitol hill that the bush administration has refused to cooperate with a related congressional inquiry several democratic leaders on

enron has not defaulted on its payments there is no way for the astros to rename enron field until at least aug without negotiating an end to the contract or the judge compelling enron to accept or reject it a hearing has been set on the astros motion for feb in the new york court in a chapter bankruptcy the debtor enron in this case does not have to accept or reject a contract until it files a reorganization plan which likely won t happen until this summer or later in arguing their case the astros maintain the association with enron has hurt their business mclane said many people believe enron owns a piece of the club one thing is clear the astros are being perceived in the public and cast in the national media as an affiliate and even an ally of enron even though the astros have done nothing wrong astros attorney paul k ferdinands argues in the legal motion the court should not allow this irreparable harm to continue in the motion the astros say the team has had to devote substantial resources to respond to a deluge of daily inquiries about the astros relationship with enron also fans and corporate sponsors may seek to distance themselves from the team because of the association with enron and the financial uncertainty of whether the company will make its million payment this august affects the astros ability to field the best team possible the motion states judge gonzalez may well buy none of those arguments said nancy rapoport dean of the university of houston law center and a bankruptcy law expert the judge is most likely to say thank you for your motion she said there s no rush and there may be more pressing executory contracts at the heart of the dispute is whether enron could re license the ballpark s name to another company in theory they might be able to profit by selling the name for more than the annual payment to the astros the team says flatly that enron cannot and there are clauses in the contract prohibiting a re licensing of the name however rapoport said in bankruptcy court such assignment clauses may not be enforced if they would be to the advantage of the debtor and its creditors beyond the assignment clauses however there is language in the naming rights contract that prevents the ballpark s name from being changed before without the club s consent said pam gardner president of business operations for the astros even gardner acknowledged however that all bets on even this type of language may be off in bankruptcy court either way the team just wants enron to be forced to accept or reject the contract so the matter can be put to rest she said despite the negative association with enron and a glum economy there s a good chance the ballpark s name could be resold for million annually possibly even more said dean bonham of the bonham group a denver sports marketing firm i m very bullish on the astros eventually coming out on top in this financially he said part of it is it s quite likely there would be a good bit of public rejoicing for the company that comes in and removes the enron name mclane said three or four local companies have contacted him about the naming rights though there have been no

noted yesterday things have changed oh have they ever there s nothing proud about houston based enron anymore and the astros as gardner politely put it would like to move in another direction with the ballpark name worried about the negative public perception of the bankrupt scandal tainted energy trader gardner said the team wants out of its year million plus naming rights contract with the company but enron won t play ball the dispute which surfaced yesterday seems a mere sideshow to this week s congressional hearings on enron s questionable financial practices but as astros officials see it staring up at that name writ bright and huge on a facade high above the right field seats among other places their lovely seat stadium might as well be called bankruptcy ballpark it s a perception issue gardner said the problem for the astros is that enron despite its financial problems has been making its annual payments under the contract and its next installment million isn t due until august enron also has held up its contract obligations on leasing a luxury box and buying season tickets gardner said we are continuing to honor our agreement enron spokeswoman karen denne said adding that the naming rights are a valuable asset and it is our responsibility to preserve that asset for enron s creditors she said lawyers for enron are reviewing the contract to determine whether the rights could be sold to help satisfy enron s creditors astros lawyers say the contract does not allow such a sale gardner said denne suggested that enron would agree to give up the naming rights for a price we ve had some discussions but they haven t offered to do that she said of a potential buyout gardner said astros officials have scoffed at the idea it remains to be seen whether the bankruptcy court in new york that is handling enron s case will let the company retain the naming rights when the next contract payment comes due in august the astros this week asked the court to decide the issue now rather than wait until summer the allegations against enron have been overwhelming gardner said fan response has intensified in the last several weeks a lot of people think the relationship between enron and the astros is stronger and closer than just a sponsorship agreement the team and company used to have a strong and close relationship enron s then chairman kenneth l lay did a whole lot of work to get this stadium built downtown gardner said he was instrumental in the process talking to a lot of people convincing a lot of people that it was the right thing to do the

not often that a big company loses billions of dollars in shareholder equity before going spectacularly bankrupt in an exploding accounting scandal that company of course is enron and the baseball team is the houston astros which barring some change will start the season playing at enron field yesterday the astros asked a federal bankruptcy court to force enron either to pledge to honor its obligations under a contract that gives the stadium its name or to reject the contract and free the astros to negotiate a naming deal with somebody else the astros say that for enron to continue to make payments under the name contract costs its creditors money and will earn them nothing enron says it can sell the right to name the stadium to another company so far enron has complied with its obligations to the astros and lawyers say its contract can be sold to a third party with the blessing of the bankruptcy court enron has paid for box seats said karen denne a spokeswoman for the company the next payment is not due until august that naming rights agreement is a valuable asset and the creditors view it as a valuable asset ms denne said it was our responsibility to preserve the value and we re doing that the astros say that enron cannot comply with the terms of the agreement and that they want to be able to resell the lucrative naming right to another company this was not our preferred way to go about this said pam gardner president of business operations for the astros since this started a few months ago we ve been trying to work in a new direction through negotiations with enron she said but those negotiations did not resolve the dispute sandra mayerson a lawyer representing several creditors in enron s bankruptcy proceedings said it was possible that the bankruptcy court could override terms of the the astros agreement with enron to allow the company to sell the naming rights and it is in everyone s interest to rename the field she added wouldn t

chairman of one of the leading congressional committees investigating the collapse of enron corp says he expects to make a major legislative push this year to address problems arising from the debacle republican rep w j billy tauzin of louisiana said he wants his house energy and commerce committee to tighten the rules governing investments in the sort of off balance sheet partnerships enron used to hide debt he also is calling for pension reforms citing concern about enron workers who lost their retirement savings and he voiced support for greater scrutiny while not ruling out complete elimination of the common corporate practice of having one accounting firm audit the books as well as consult on business practices as was the case with enron and its accounting firm arthur andersen llp we can see several things emerging from the congressional hearings mr tauzin said at the same time though he warned against legislative overreach suggesting too aggressive action could create incredible problems for the stock market and for investors he also voiced misgivings about efforts by some on capitol hill to turn enron s collapse into an overtly political matter my concern is that because democrats have decided to enronize republicans on this issue that the thing gets bogged down politically and to me that s terrible mr tauzin said in an interview we owe a bigger obligation to the country than an election in november mr tauzin s comments provided the clearest indication yet that lawmakers despite the distractions of the unfolding election year won t be content to simply probe enron s failure in the senate key members of the banking committee having lost faith in the accounting industry in the wake of enron signaled support for direct federal oversight sens richard

can the accounting profession police themselves mr shelby asked i don t think they can in an appearance before the senate panel federal reserve chairman alan greenspan agreed changes are needed but cautioned prudence it s important to ask what are the consequences he said mr tauzin whose panel has sweeping jurisdiction over business regulation in the u s is seen as a good barometer of the legislative outlook in the gop controlled house as with mr greenspan mr tauzin too counseled some caution he described the problems at enron as an aberration not necessarily an indication of systemic problems in the business community and he urged regulators such as the securities and exchange commission and the fasb which has quasi government status to begin moving ahead of congress to respond to perceived problems but he also made clear his intention to act our obligation to supervise the operation of fasb is real and i m going to exercise it he said mr tauzin cited specific concern with existing accounting rules that allowed enron to create off book partnerships with outside investments of as little as and the balance of funding coming from the company it s a surprise to a lot of people that such a rule exists he said suggesting he thought it was always he added i should think we ought to have a better rule than that describing the current situation as not adequate mr tauzin also indicated his intention to wade into the debate over whether to separate the bookkeeping and consulting services offered by accounting firms we have to examine that now in light of enron he said he suggested he is ready to conclude that we need stronger oversight of those two accounting roles but he hasn t yet determined where to draw the line legislatively dawn kopecki of dow jones newswires

documents and sacked a number of employees including mr duncan the creditors said in a court filing that a thorough examination of enron deals carried out prior to its bankruptcy filing in december was crucial to their attempt to discover enron s true financial condition the revelation that andersen and enron shredded documents has prompted other creditors to demand the appointment of an examiner at enron who would investigate allegations of wrongdoing at the company some have even asked for a court appointed trustee to run the company the publication of a damning internal report on

yesterday also issued a subpoena saying he would compel the former enron chief to appear on february in his testimony before the panel mr berardino said his company repeatedly questioned enron s accounting practices pointing to a widely reported meeting of andersen auditors in which some of enron s practices were labelled intelligent gambling however while accounting rules allowed auditors to raise their concerns with enron s board which mr berardino said they did regularly they prevented any public disclosure unless there were clear violations of accepted accounting principles our only option is to resign the engagement but resigning an engagement may destroy a company that is fundamentally sound he said so those are our choices when faced with a client whose accounting treatments are risky give it a pass or give it the death penalty mr berardino s recommendations were largely ignored by committee investigators who repeatedly questioned the andersen chief on the auditor s role in enron s questionable financial reporting mr berardino declined to answer most of the questions insisting he had no direct knowledge of how the enron audit was conducted a response that enraged some

to pay for the gun you don t feel you have a duty to blow the whistle mr berardino said andersen was aware of enron s now infamous private partnerships which enabled the company to take debts off its balance sheets but insisted they were set up by enron executives and investment bankers with andersen only giving passive judgments as to whether they passed accepted accounting principles he added

message this year said their campaign group s executive director howard wolfson but neither bush s late january swing through the south nor a recent series of speeches by democratic leaders came close to the full scale attack on moneyed interests that defines true populism these rhetorical stabs acknowledged voters anger over news that top executives made tens of millions of dollars while ordinary workers saw their jobs and retirement funds vanish but they did not propose significant legal or regulatory changes that might rattle the nation s corporate hierarchy a structure that pours millions of dollars into republican and democratic coffers alike true economic populism in the sense of william jennings bryan would involve a direct attack on corporate america said claremont mckenna college political science professor jack pitney you re not hearing anything like bryan s cross of gold speech populist themes reemerge periodically in american politics from the whiskey rebellion to the bull

deductions for excessive executive pay and letting shareholders determine the compensation of top executives but little came of it all and executive compensation packages skyrocketed in the s the

could prove politically troublesome for bush even if the scandal is never linked directly to the white house voters tell pollsters they associate bush more closely with corporate influence than they do many other political figures the president combats this potential problem not so much by offering populist changes in government as by returning to his folksy campaign rhetoric in speeches in battleground states or gop leaning regions he portrays himself as a fighter against washington in other words a populist his aides say thank goodness we cut taxes when we did bush told an applauding crowd in winston salem n c last wednesday the best way to help an economy recover is to let hard working people keep more of their money when they get more money in their pocket they spend more money and as they spend more money it helps create jobs bush pivoted to the opposition and for those who want to do away with tax relief you don t know what you re talking about he said we ve got to trust

by democratic consultants stan greenberg james carville and robert shrum urged democrats to seize upon the enron issue to contrast themselves with republicans enron has the potential to shape the entire political environment for impact other issues and reduce confidence in the bush administration and republicans the report said but the poll raises doubts about the political benefit democrats might reap from the issue respondents agreed percent to percent with the statement what happened at enron is indicative of a larger pattern of abuses by big corporations that have too much influence over what happens in washington but they agreed percent to percent that the bush administration is not part of the enron mess pushing the populist refrain could reignite an old debate between democratic progressives and centrists many remain divided over the wisdom of vice president al gore s emphasis on populist themes in the election at his convention speech gore promised voters he was

they are latching onto the enron scandal as a way to make courses on everything from accounting to crisis management come alive some teachers are treading cautiously partly because business school case studies usually focus on historical events not unfolding dramas and partly because the enron collapse is so complicated but the revelations about the maneuverings of enron corporation executives and the actions of the company s auditor arthur andersen are too tempting to pass up professors say roger d martin an assistant accounting professor at the business school at indiana university says he introduced a graduate accounting class on the company early in november when enron had to restate its earnings and things started smoking professor martin said he planned to use enron s financial meltdown for years to come as a case study in his advanced accounting class this is a classic case in almost everything related to accounting he said if anything it might make it tough to keep the conversation going in just one direction because there are so many angles other business school professors say they are eager to use enron to enliven business cases that too often focus on old examples like the ford pinto gas tank of the s students now are largely unimpressed if something is more than four to five years old said al hartgraves an accounting professor at the goizueta business school at emory university in atlanta before his students left for their christmas break in the second week of december professor hartgraves promised to e mail them a summary of the company s situation and did so at the end of the month then a couple of weeks ago he created a computer bulletin board about enron over the internal e mail system that connects roughly emory business students within hours he said more than students had asked him for bulletin board access we ve seen audit failures before with companies like waste management and sunbeam professor hartgraves said but never anything as big as this at brandeis university in waltham mass alfonso f canella an adjunct professor who teaches a class in financial modeling said he planned to use enron to illustrate the mechanics as well as the riskiness of putting together limited partnerships especially when the deals were not listed on a company s balance sheet not everyone is convinced that enron s troubles belong in every classroom jan barton an assistant accounting professor at emory thinks that it is appropriate to use enron in an introductory course on financial statement analysis but that its accounting and energy trading practices may be too complicated for most students even when it comes to teaching more advanced students professor barton said he preferred to focus on companies like dell computer sears roebuck wal mart and microsoft whose financial statement practices and products are easier to understand i don t want to talk about a company that operates in a funky industry like utilities and whose transactions involved things like financial derivative contracts mr barton said still diana c robertson an associate professor of organization and management at goizueta in time concluded that the enron case could not be ignored in december she decided to stick to well documented cases like the antitrust charges against microsoft and nike s foreign labor practices for her business ethics classes but as enron unraveled she decided that using a business story in the making rather than one that is years or decades old was too wonderful to pass up raymond d horton chairman of the columbia university business school s management division said he would allocate plenty of time to the subject this winter in his course on the modern political economy we re all itching to discuss it he said pointing to a pile of enron news clippings on his desk robert rupe a second year finance student at columbia said one lecture for a course on corporate turnarounds he just signed up for is titled simply enron a useful point in the enron case business professors say is the light it sheds on the evolution of the american corporation into unexpected forms for example anne carter an economics professor at brandeis says it helps illuminate the nature of the modern corporation which often bears little resemblance to the mythical manufacturing and farming companies that appear in many textbooks for one thing she said enron is a good way to show students just how much of an imbalance there is in the information investors typically receive and how a company can exploit that imbalance professor carter plans to devote three classes to enron this semester in an undergraduate course she teaches i really think that enron shows students that the market now is very different from the

attracting downstream scavengers of course this includes the lawyers especially lawsuit king bill lerach who recently posed before tv cameras in houston with a carton of what he claimed were shredded enron documents but before he cashes in one more time mr lerach s own legal practices deserve some greater public scrutiny for example a los angeles grand jury is investigating whether the lerach law firm milberg weiss bershad hynes lerach paid plaintiffs to sign onto class action lawsuits there s also the recent decision by a federal judge to give the lead counsel slot in a class action suit to a lower cost law firm the judge said that milberg s stiff fees would have gobbled up too much of any money its clients might recover milberg s appeal on the latter will be heard by the ninth circuit court of appeals on february this all deserves more attention than it s received because mr lerach is not just any old tort warrior the milberg firm accounts for the lion s share of all federal shareholders suits and in california mr lerach is approaching bill gates levels of market share with enron s failure a movement is also afoot to make tort lawyers the big beneficiaries they re mobilizing to repeal a modest tort reform bill that reined in the worst of the tort bar s securities lawsuits mr lerach is himself now posing as a defender of enron shareholders and he s even been retained by calpers the big public pension fund that had invested in enron partnerships mark this down as wildebeest hiring hyenas as bodyguards the lerach methods have been challenged before three years ago he lost big when the firm paid out million to settle an abuse of process lawsuit brought against it by a chicago based consulting firm according to california press reports today s grand jury investigation revolves around a beverly hills eye surgeon who is in prison for fraud and who has appeared as a plaintiff in a number of suits filed by milberg it certainly wouldn t be kosher for a law firm to induce victims into filing contingency fee claims mr lerach s standard defense is that his rough methods are the only way to make big business accountable but that s just what makes the issue of milberg s attorneys fees now headed for the ninth circuit so juicy no one in this case is denying anyone her day in court all the ruling by u s district court judge vaughn walker did was ensure that if the plaintiffs win they won t have to turn nearly all of their winnings over to the milberg plutocrats the story begins as many milberg stories do with a drop in the share price of a company in this case copper mountain networks milberg quickly moved in but milberg s wasn t the only suit so when it came time to choose a lead counsel judge walker asked for rival bids when he looked at the price sheets he found that another firm s lower fees served the interests of the shareholders better than milberg s hefty ones this judgment is startling because when it comes to fees lawyers nearly always stick together but recent fees have become so obscene in the case of tobacco and asbestos into the billions of dollars that they may have opened up a new political and legal vulnerability for the tort bar lawyers love to shout price controls when anyone talks about their fees but lawyers aren t normal businessmen as judge walker noted in his opinion lawyers are not independent contractors but are fiduciaries for absent class members they are officers of the court this is the same understanding embodied in the american bar association s model rules of professional conduct which forbids unreasonable fees on precisely these grounds that understanding is even more critical in class actions because the client being represented is absent and thus has no real voice while in a normal case the client contracts with a lawyer in class actions the lawyer essentially conscripts the clients then if the lawyer wins or settles the case he takes the bulk of the winnings as fees often leaving a pittance for the actual plaintiffs i have the greatest practice of law in the world mr lerach once quipped to a group of corporate directors i have no clients but it is about time he got some adult legal supervision the tort bar has become so rich increasingly at the expense of its own clients that its abuses need to be reined in for the good of the broader

by robert s greenberger staff reporter of the wall street journal the wall street journal a copyright c dow jones company inc washington as federal investigators and congress expand their probe into the collapse of enron corp lawmakers want to revisit a law limiting lawsuits that will make it difficult for company shareholders to recoup their losses the senate judiciary committee today will hear testimony on the private securities litigation reform act and how its provisions shielding corporate advisers from shareholder lawsuits could block enron employees and shareholders from suing the accountants and lawyers who helped create the complicated partnerships that contributed to the giant energy trader s demise the law does nothing to inhibit the government from taking civil and criminal action against enron its lawyers and accountants enron once the seventh largest company in the u s by revenues saw its share price implode last fall amid allegations of questionable accounting and overstated earnings and was forced to seek bankruptcy court protection its employees whose retirement savings accounts were tied to company stock and outside shareholders saw their investments evaporate the bill was part of the republican party s contract with america a platform of bills aimed at overhauling government programs and the legal system that the gop used to win control of the house in the elections the securities litigation bill was intended to curb a rash of lawsuits filed by shareholders angry over company performance particularly in the volatile high technology industry it had the strong backing of the accountants and high tech executives who saw themselves increasingly vulnerable to frivolous class action suits the committee will probe how the law tightens rules on bringing complaints that initiate lawsuits and how it protects accountants and other professionals from exposure to complete liability for corporate losses and from lawsuits seeking triple damages overall the law partly shields the accountants lawyers bankers and other outsiders to whom victims might turn for redress from wrongs by a company in bankruptcy court by forcing through special exemptions for securities congress has contributed to the wild west mentality reflected in enron s hidden partnerships said the judiciary panel s chairman sen patrick leahy d vt should legislation to change the law come out of the hearings however it is unclear if it would be made retroactive and aid enron shareholders steven schatz a california attorney who was selected as a witness by sen orrin hatch of utah the committee s ranking republican rejects the notion that the law makes it difficult for plaintiffs to bring legitimate lawsuits overall it has a positive effect he said because it has caused the plaintiffs bar to be more circumspect with regard to whom they sue one example is that the law requires that a complaint in a securities fraud case must present details giving rise to a strong inference of fraud previously the complaint didn t have to be as detailed meanwhile the rules have also been changed to bar the beginning of discovery until after a court has decided whether to allow the case to go forward previously plaintiffs attorneys could begin to gather documents and interview witnesses when the complaint was filed columbia university law professor jack coffee said that taken together the two rules are a catch you can t get discovery unless you have strong evidence of fraud and you can t get strong evidence of fraud without discovery the statute also substitutes proportionate liability for the old law under which everyone involved in the financial scheme would be fully liable for all the damages involved so in most circumstances under the new law the amount for which an accounting or law firm could be held liable would be only a fraction of the for which it might previously have been sued this could be crucial for plaintiffs when a defendant company such as enron is in bankruptcy court finally it limits the use of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act or rico in civil suits involving securities the rico law was very unpopular with corporate defense attorneys because among other provisions it permits an award to plaintiffs of triple damages although the examination of the law involves such arcane legal issues it is fueled by politics democrats are eager to pin the enron debacle on pro business republicans consumer groups also are weighing in the consumer federation of america consumers union and u s public interest research group are among the groups pointing to a dec letter they wrote lawmakers opposing the bill this legislation will protect financial swindlers from being held accountable to their

hi all attached is the inside ferc summary of the ferc s order in the transco line order proceeding and in the texas gas cash out proceeding transco is saying they won t implement prior to april but haven t decided on an implementation and training schedule as of yet the order did not specify a date by which transco had to implement transco will have to make another filing to comply with this order so it may still be a little while before everything is finalized given that the ferc did not speak to the cost of the system in this order almost m it s likely that the dollars will be subject to the on going negotiations taking place in transco s rp rate case proceeding i ll coordinate with tammy to insure that we ve got the necessary edi testing plan in place and that we make the necessary unify changes on texas gas this represents a minor win for us we had argued that texas gas proposal was not consistent with order and that they should adopt a more transco like scheme that creates uncertainty w o creating undue penalties texas gas will have to refile we ll have another go round between the marketing companies producers and the ldc s on the texas gas system will keep you posted please let me know if you have any questions suzanne x transco gets green light to implement line system other rate changes capping a long running debate over the line proposal transcontinental gas pipe line corp with only a minor exception or two received approval from ferc to implement a new online interactive computer system last month s ruling also went a long way toward completing transco s effort to comply with orders and the line system was proposed to enable transco and other subsidiaries of the williams cos inc to put in place new practices and services including ones related to compliance with orders and according to transco its new scheme cannot be supported by its existing computer systems but the commission last spring said it was not satisfied with transco s proposal and asked for a more detailed explanation of how line complies with orders and if april looking at the line plan from an order and perspective ferc in the sept order rp et al found most of the scheme to its liking it accepted transco s proposal to change the capacity release bidding and awarding processes to incorporate pooling services in its tariff as a new pooling rate schedule and to provide that any adjustments to a demand bill will be included in a subsequent demand bill rather than the subsequent commodity bill the commission approved transco s proposal on scheduling equality which allows shippers acquiring released capacity to submit a nomination at the earliest opportunity after the acquisition of capacity to raise its comfort level about the provision ferc directed transco to change the tariff to permit a shipper s nomination to coincide with the notification of the capacity release transaction and to remove restrictions on the releasing shipper s ability to specify when the release will become effective ferc also generally was pleased with the provision directing customers to indemnify and hold harmless transco against all claims in response to one protester the commission told the company to remove language that would force customers to indemnify transco s affiliates as well on order matters ferc was mostly sympathetic to transco s positions on issues such as imbalance services operational controls and penalty revenue sharing ferc was less enthused with transco s preferred approach to interaction between the pipeline s segmentation and discounting policies refuting the claim that it already complies with order on this issue ferc directed transco to add language to its tariff creating a presumption that transco can rebut a segmenting shipper s right to retain a discounted rate as long as transco demonstrates that a segmented or secondary point is not similarly situated to point identified in the original transaction transco also must add a procedure to its tariff that requires requests to retain discounts to be processed within two hours ferc also accepted transco s existing imbalance cash out tolerances and tiered cash out mechanisms but wanted more information on proposed unauthorized overrun penalties the pipeline has not ad equately justified why such substantial overrun penalties should apply on non critical days said the commission ferc rejected transco s proposed transportation charge for imbalance trading which the pipeline said was needed to recover what it asserts are lost transportation charges the commission ruled that transco has failed to demonstrate that imbalance trades between zones necessarily results in a loss of transportation revenue but the commission went on to say that it may be willing to reconsider a remedy if transco can show that shippers are abusing imbalance trading to avoid certain charges transco also was directed to justify its proposal to prohibit shippers from trading transportation imbalances and operational balancing agreement imbalances ferc said that it is not clear from transco s explanation why oba imbalances are so different from shipper transportation imbalances that the two cannot be traded ferc accepted texas gas proposal to eliminate imbalances on its system by revising its cashout mechanism while rejecting the proposed use of high low daily pricing for cashouts the revamped mechanism which was developed during and after a technical conference would enable texas gas transmission co to remove the incentive to engage in price arbitrage on its system ferc said to stop customers from gaming its system texas gas in march proposed rp a plan to create a new monthly imbalance tier that would not be subject to cashouts to eliminate pool to pool transfers in the calculation of customer imbalances and to do away with the provision allowing a processor replacing plant volume reduction to have its imbalances cashed out at of the applicable index price seeing the need for the proposed changes the commission noted that texas gas has demonstrated with its data a close correlation between the imbalance and price arbitrage that has been taking place for years and has not subsided however ferc rejected the idea of changing the applicable cashout price index at all tier levels to a percentage of either the highest or lowest daily price during the month directing texas gas to drop the proposed language the order explained that daily high low index prices may unduly increase penalties for imbalances which is contrary to order the order went on to say that a less draconian measure may be appropriate for instance texas gas could propose a mechanism that would inject an element of uncertainty regarding the eventual price if it wanted to provide an incentive for shippers to remain in balance ferc said,Insider Misuse,Phishing,0.49997960727022833,False

power war by philip j lavelle union tribune staff writer may a major san diego business group urged gov gray davis yesterday to take emergency steps in the energy crisis including seizing power plants an action the governor said may be in the cards davis met over lunch for nearly two hours with members of the san diego building owners and managers association overseers of about commercial properties here the meeting at the university club at symphony towers downtown was closed to the media in remarks to reporters later davis repeated his hard line against out of state energy producers relating a threat made to a dozen power executives in a private meeting may i told the generators face to face as close as i am to you gentlemen you are going to lose your plants and i m going to sign a windfall profits tax unless you help us get through this summer without blackouts and without staggering prices davis also said he told them you know you ve been ripping us off acting in a predatory manner if you do it this summer you leave me no choice but to take your plants and sign a windfall profits tax so the ball is in your court gentlemen building association executive craig benedetto said the group had a frank exchange with davis we want to do our fair share on conservation but we re also concerned about the supply side he said the group strongly urged him to use his emergency powers to do whatever is necessary including seizing plants association president cybele thompson said davis asked for a string of conservation measures yet some cannot be implemented without state intervention she said for example davis urged that air conditioning thermostats be set at degrees but a lot of our leases don t permit it she said while in san diego davis received an honorary doctor of science degree from scripps research institute davis intensifies attacks on texas firms by ed mendel union tribune staff writer may sacramento gov gray davis is stepping up his attacks on texas energy companies shifting blame in the california electricity crisis to the home state of president bush we are literally in a war with energy companies who are price gouging us davis told reporters while responding to bush s energy plan this week many of those companies are in texas the governor suggested that most of the power plants that california utilities sold under a failed deregulation plan were purchased by energy companies in the southwest anyone could have purchased the california power plants davis said but the people who bought them just happened to be from the southwest however a state energy commission report shows that when california utilities sold more than power plants capable of producing megawatts texas firms purchased plants producing about megawatts davis also suggested that the bush administration is failing to give california the same price relief on electricity that texas has imposed on itself so if texas can have some kind of price relief davis said i think california is entitled to price relief but the cap that texas adopted in march prevents energy companies from offering to sell power for more than per megawatt hour far above the average that california expects to pay for non contracted power this spring the campaign operation for davis who is up for re election next year and has been mentioned as a potential bush opponent in distributed a news release yesterday saying that davis is emerging as a national spokesman for the democrats on energy issues the governor yesterday appointed two members of former democratic presidential candidate al gore s campaign mark fabiani and chris lehane as interim communication consultants he named gore s former deputy chief of staff nancy mcfadden as senior adviser the governor will give the democratic response to bush s weekly radio address today while davis blames the lone star state none of pacific gas and electric s power plants which produce megawatts was sold to texas firms they were sold to duke of north carolina mirant of georgia and calpine of california the biggest purchaser of southern california edison power plants was aes corp of virginia which obtained megawatts reliant a texas firm bought plants from edison that can produce megawatts destec of houston and nrg energy of minneapolis purchased two edison plants with an output of megawatts dynegy of houston and nrg energy purchased plants producing megawatts from san diego gas and electric davis has said in nationally televised interviews that there is an historic transfer of wealth from california to houston a large electricity marketing firm with close ties to bush enron also is based in houston but davis has focused much of his criticism on reliant whose profits soared last year reliant openly rejected davis call last week for generators to accept a percent reduction in the debt they are owed by california utilities reliant also was the only generator that appealed a federal court order to provide emergency power to california davis began singling out reliant after it charged the state per megawatt hour for emergency power needed by the california grid reliant s president joe bob perkins said in a teleconference with california reporters yesterday that reliant charged the high price because it did not want to run a small reserve plant that can only be used for a limited number of days the state of california which has spent about billion buying power for utility customers since january made emergency purchases of megawatt hours from reliant on may and paying per megawatt hour for a total of in texas the public utilities commission adopted a per megawatt hour cap on bids to supply emergency power as a circuit breaker in case prices somehow skyrocketed after texas deregulates next year i realize that amount has been reached in california said terry hadley a spokesman for the texas puc nothing close to that has been reached in texas hadley said the most paid for emergency power by the texas grid operator was per megawatt hour in he said the average price is to per megawatt hour texas has a surplus of power unlike california which has to import about percent of its power texas also has a self contained power grid that covers about percent of the state including houston dallas san antonio and austin california is part of a sprawling western power grid davis and others have been pushing for wholesale price caps on power in the west the texas puc rejected price caps and adopted a high bid cap as a fail safe saying that would still allow prices to signal whether new power plants are needed the governor yesterday also appointed a new energy adviser kellan fluckiger who is on loan from the independent system operator which operates the california power grid head of puc unveils evidence of power plant manipulation associated press may los angeles the head of the california public utilities commission provided a state senate committee with evidence showing three power generators reduced electricity production and then benefited from the resulting high prices while testifying before the committee friday puc president loretta lynch displayed charts that tracked electricity prices and power generation at three plants on a single day last november according to the graphs after the plants reduced production during the middle of the day the state was forced to declare two separate power emergencies which indicate electricity reserves had fallen seriously low after the shortfall in supply helped cause a spike in prices the companies operating the three plants suddenly increased their electricity production to almost full capacity allowing them to capitalize on the much higher rates we certainly see a pattern lynch told the committee which is investigating alleged manipulation of the state s wholesale power market by energy suppliers many generators are playing on their experience and playing to an extent california maintenance records reviewed by investigators show that there were no valid reasons for the plants to cut back production lynch said she would not identify the power plants involved however lynch did say that they are owned by at least two companies sen joseph dunn who heads the special committee investigating alleged market manipulation said lynch s testimony on its face is very damning he said his committee has uncovered additional preliminary evidence showing that several power companies have allegedly engaged in similar behavior during a break in friday s hearing a spokeswoman for a trade group of major power suppliers told the los angeles times that there have been no coordinated efforts to shrink supplies to increase profits there has been no collusion said jean muoz of the independent energy producers association the puc and state atty gen bill lockyer are jointly investigating the exorbitant wholesale power prices that have cost california billions and brought major utilities to financial ruin california economy braces for billion electric rate hike by michael liedtke associated press may san francisco higher power costs zapped restauranteur marino sandoval and his customers even before california regulators decided this week how to allocate a billion electricity rate hike the highest in the state s history faced with soaring natural gas rates that tripled his utility bill sandoval last month raised the prices at his popular mexican restaurant chain el balazo by as much as percent on some items a giant burrito that cost at the end of march costs saturday we had to do it because it seemed like the price of everything from our beans to our tortillas was going up almost every day our higher prices have everything to do with the higher energy prices said sandoval who runs six restaurants in san francisco and the east bay from hotels to bagel shops businesses throughout california have been raising their prices or imposing special surcharges to offset rising power costs most of the increases so far have reflected higher natural gas costs which utilities have been passing along to their customers throughout the state s power crisis now businesses and households are bracing for electricity rate increases that could balloon the bills of the largest users of the state s two biggest utilities pacific gas and electric co and southern california edison co the higher rates which will begin appearing in june s utility bills threaten to jolt the state s already jittery economy pretty soon we may see california staring down the barrel of a recession said dave puglia a vice president for apco a public affairs firm hired by california business interests to study the economic effect of the state s energy woes until now california businesses have only had to pay a fraction of the state s staggering electricity bill which is on a pace to reach billion this year about times more than in by itself the billion rate increase approved by the california public utilities commission probably isn t enough to topple the state s roughly trillion economy the sixth largest in the world it will cause some hardships particularly for some small business owners but from the macro point of view these rate increases aren t going to have a major impact on california s output predicted sung won sohn chief economist for wells fargo co which runs the biggest bank headquartered in the state but some business leaders are worried the hike will represent the coup de grace for many companies already reeling from rising expenses for gasoline natural gas health care benefits and workers compensation insurance against this backdrop many employers also face pressure to raise their workers wages to help pay for california s high housing costs if this keeps up at some point we are going to reach a breaking point in the economy said allan zaremberg president of the california chamber of commerce the california chamber is part of the california alliance for energy and economic stability a coalition that sought to shift more of the electricity rate increase from businesses to households under the plan approved by the puc businesses are expected to pay about billion more for electricity and households will pay an additional billion even if they are spared on their utility bills consumers still will be pinched by higher prices for goods and services as businesses pass along their electricity price increases some california firms particularly those making commodities sold around the world won t be able to substantially raise their prices without losing business from customers who will buy from competitors in other states and countries manufacturers of cement glass paper products and steel are among the companies that probably won t be able to pass along their higher energy costs puglia said the rate increases mean that utility bills will consume about percent to percent of a big manufacturer s budget puglia estimated up from about percent now i wouldn t be surprised if we see some companies go out of business because of this said justin bradley director of energy programs for the silicon valley manufacturing association a high tech trade group even if they don t shut down completely many companies likely will lay off workers as they cut costs to pay for power the california manufacturers and technology association estimates that the energy crisis will result in the loss of jobs or about more than the entire dot com industry has laid off nationwide during the past months painful though they may be higher electricity rates and some resulting layoffs are a better alternative than the increased number of blackouts that probably would have occurred if retail prices hadn t been raised according to most economists people are wildly exaggerating how much this is going to hurt the california economy said stephen levy director of the center for continuing study of the california economy a palo alto research firm the rate increases are part of a long term solution for california we needed them to stabilize the market on balance this is a good thing even though his monthly utility bill at one of his restaurants rose from last year to this year el balazo s sandoval shares levy s optimism after all customers continue to pour into his restaurants despite his restaurant s higher menu prices business is so good that i have been too busy to think about whether i am going to have to raise my prices again he said if i have to i will i don t think people are going to stop eating because of this price information sought from natural gas companies by h josef hebert associated press may washington a federal regulatory agency late friday directed natural gas companies selling in california to provide detailed information for better investigations of possible price gouging and market abuses the federal energy regulatory commission said it viewed the unusually high prices of wholesale natural gas in california as a matter of serious concern but didn t have enough information to determine if they are illegal it noted that the spot price of natural gas charged at the california border has been exceedingly high since december when it ranged between and per thousand cubic feet compared to to elsewhere in the county the most recent prices at the california border exceed more than twice the wholesale price in other parts of the country such a disparity over such a long period of time would not be expected in a competitive market the agency said california officials have argued for months that ferc should intervene and more aggressively investigate high natural gas prices which have been a major cause of some of the run up in electricity costs in the state many of the state s power plants run on natural gas the order asks for a wide range of information at the end of each calendar quarter including volumes of gas sold prices transportation rates daily operational pipeline capacity and volumes flowing in and out of the state allegations of price gouging and market manipulation have been at the center of a hearing by a ferc administrative law judge all this week the hearing will continue next week the case involves a major natural gas pipeline owned by the houston based el paso corp which supplies southern california california regulators and two of the states financially troubled utilities filed a formal complaint with ferc alleging that manipulation by two el paso subsidiaries one a gas marketer and the other an operator of the pipeline led to billion in natural gas overcharges since march el paso corp has strongly denied the allegation for the past week attorneys for el paso have questioned witnesses from the california public utilities commission in an attempt to disprove the charges the witnesses admitted they failed to consider some additional factors that could have affected prices in their analyses but they did not back away from their conclusion in support of their argument california officials have provided internal el paso memos which have not been disclosed publicly that allegedly discuss market control in connection with gas flowing through the pipeline administrative law judge curtis wagner has said the documents contain statements that could lead one to believe there was an abuse of pipeline capacity he is not expected to make a ruling on the case until later this summer a final decision on what action to take if any would be up to the full commission davis sharpens attack on bush energy plan power he also hires high profile consultants in effort to boost his political standing by dan morain and mark z barabak times staff writers sacramento gov gray davis is going on the attack as the democratic party s point man against president bush s energy plan even as he seeks to bolster his drooping standing in california by hiring consultants who honed their crisis management skills during the scandal ridden clinton administration davis was expected to again criticize bush s energy plan today as he makes the official democratic response to bush s weekly radio address in the last week davis has variously blasted the president s energy plan and texas energy companies on an abc talk show on cnn and in an opinion piece for the washington post in an interview with associated press davis vowed to hold everyone accountable myself the energy producers and the president of the united states we are literally in a war with energy companies who are price gouging us davis said friday many of those companies are in texas mr president you didn t create this problem but you are the only one who can solve it at the same time davis all but acknowledged his own political problems when he announced that he has retained two political aides mark fabiani and chris lehane the two who also do work for southern california edison will be paid by taxpayers at a combined rate of per month more than the earned by the governor himself lehane known for his tart tongued commentary was vice president al gore s main campaign spokesman and had a knack for getting under bush s skin during the campaign fabiani a harvard law school graduate became a highly partisan and acerbic white house defender when president clinton was mired in investigations ranging from the whitewater land deal to the monica lewinsky affair fabiani developed his reputation for being able to handle crises while defending mayor tom bradley against various investigations near the end of the late mayor s tenure in political circles the nickname of their firm is masters of disaster davis decision to retain lehane and fabiani comes as the governor s once sterling poll numbers have fallen sharply and he faces persistent criticism over his handling of the energy crisis their arrival also corresponds to davis increasingly aggressive stand on the energy crisis in recent days davis for the first time has attacked an individual generator reliant energy of houston for charging a record per megawatt for electricity on two days last week he also dared president bush and vice president dick cheney to stand up to their friends in the energy business by capping wholesale electricity prices charged in california davis more assertive stance comes as democrats nationwide step up their attacks on the president using the energy plan to launch a broader assault on bush s leadership and policies one of the glaring flaws in the bush energy plan is that it offers no short term relief for consumers said dan pfeiffer a spokesman for the democratic governors assn which davis chairs and there is no better example of that than the fact he does nothing to control runaway prices in california in addition to portraying bush as ignoring the plight of california the nation s largest electoral prize democrats see bush s energy response as a way of confirming their broader assertion that he is captive to oil interests this is a way for us to show how they are really an administration and a party that is bought and paid for by special interests said jenny backus a spokeswoman for the democratic national committee to press the case the party has created a snide web site www grandoldpetroleum and will soon start running tv ads attacking gop lawmakers over the energy issue including in california paul maslin the governor s pollster said davis had given the president a grace period after he took office in january to see how bush would address the energy problem but the governor grew increasingly frustrated when it became clear we weren t going to get any help from washington for his part bush made glancing reference to california in a speech friday at a hydroelectric plant in pennsylvania part of his tour to sell the administration s energy blueprint the president praised californians for doing a fantastic job in conservation and yet they re lacking energy they re having blackouts bush said we all must be deeply concerned about our fellow citizens in the great state of california but the problems in california show that you cannot conserve your way to energy independence while bush did not mention the governor the president s deputies have rushed to criticize him virginia gov james gilmore head of the republican national committee suggested davis was hypocritical to attack bush when the president is the one who came forward with the first energy plan we ve seen in years he s going to have to answer the question of what he s done as governor gilmore said while he s in the process of attacking one might suspect he may be diverting attention away from his own record on thursday environmental protection agency administrator christine todd whitman was overheard criticizing davis to iowa republican party official darrell kearney he s had plenty of time to do something and he hasn t done anything she said as she left a meeting room in nevada iowa where bush had just finished speaking some more independent observers see political liabilities in the bush plan namely the focus on long term solutions at a time voters are growing increasingly upset about high gas prices and soaring utility bills while the administration talks about how we approach things in the next five years there s not a lot of empathy or understanding for what s affecting people now said stuart rothenberg a nonpartisan political analyst in washington maybe it s unfair to talk about bush and cheney s oil backgrounds and texas backgrounds rothenberg said but it s an obvious thing for critics to do rothenberg predicted a backlash that could cost republicans control of congress next year if the energy issue continues to grow and americans really become concerned it puts the burden on the white house and republicans to change that davis new aides while considered expert in solving the kind of political crisis threatening davis pose the potential of controversy on their own as consultants lehane and fabiani unlike government officials are not required to file conflict of interest statements detailing their holdings and sources of income however in an interview on friday lehane acknowledged that he and fabiani have worked for about two months as consultants for southern california edison he insisted there is no conflict davis is struggling to win legislative approval of a deal he struck with edison to rescue the utility from bankruptcy several lawmakers oppose the deal contending that it is too rich for edison both sides edison and davis are in agreement on what needs to be done here lehane said as the governor said we are literally in a war with these out of state generators although lehane and fabiani will be working on broader communications issues for davis harry snyder of consumers union a critic of the davis edison deal blasted davis decision to hire consultants who also work for the utility davis has done everything politically wrong snyder said he hasn t done anything that is consistent with the democratic process it is the worst abuse of power that i have seen in years of lobbying others suggested that davis was helping himself by bringing the duo aboard mark is the premier crisis manager in the country in terms of communication strategy democratic political consultant bill carrick said he has tremendous experience he takes the incoming you get hit with something in the morning he knows how to turn it around by the afternoon lehane said the governor s decision to hire them does not suggest davis will become more pugnacious although he added that davis is not someone afraid to pick a fight when someone like the out of state generators represent policies that are bad for the people of california gov davis has been very successful in politics for quite some time in this state lehane said he has a keen understanding of how this state works and how politics in this state works i don t think his style is going to change or be any different than he has been throughout his career copyright los angeles times puc allegations detailed hearing the commission

the previous year although no firm has been singled out by the puc or the attorney general s office atlanta based mirant corp said inspectors have visited company plants more than times this year and have found no wrongdoing mirant has run its plants voluntarily and continually throughout the crisis the company said in a statement friday but lynch said friday that visits to more than plants by puc

defends policies and says davis rhetoric could harm california by nancy vogel times staff writer sacramento the top executive of a houston based energy company singled out for criticism this week by gov gray davis defended his company friday and warned that the governor s rhetoric will ultimately hurt california on wednesday we were called obstructionist said joe bob perkins chief executive of reliant energy which bought five southern california power plants when the state launched deregulation in i don t think it s obstructionist to supply record amounts of power from old plants in order to keep the lights on perkins said i don t think it s obstructionist to invest more than million in alone to upgrade the plants and reduce emission levels i don t think it s obstructionist to continue to run our facilities at times when there s been no guarantee of payment in a telephone conference call with reporters perkins said california officials must lessen the rhetoric and focus on efforts to mitigate the impacts of summer blackouts perkins said threats of windfall profits taxes and plant seizures could scare off substantial business from california for months davis has disparaged private power plant owners in california as gougers and profiteers but until last week he did not single out individual companies last thursday after state power buyers paid an extraordinary per megawatt hour davis broke the confidentiality he had maintained on state power purchases and named reliant as the seller reliant has sued to get out of its obligation to sell power to the state and refused to discuss forgiving some portion of the million it is owed by california utilities they re one of only a couple of generators that say absolutely no way no how are they going to negotiate for anything less than davis spokesman steve maviglio said after the reliant executive s remarks the governor s recent attack has made some reliant officials wonder if he is building a case to seize control of its power plants davis has threatened to commandeer plants to bring down wholesale power costs perkins said his company set a high price last week to discourage the state from buying the power which was produced at a small inefficient plant near santa barbara that cannot run more than nine days a year because of air pollution regulations reliant officials said they wanted to reserve the plant for use later this summer maviglio said reliant s argument defies logic when you make a bid you want somebody to buy the power copyright los angeles times puc chief alleges price collusion power she cites evidence that plants were shut down to create artificial shortages an industry spokesman calls the accusation idiocy by rich connell and robert lopez times staff writers state investigators have uncovered evidence that a cartel of power companies shut down plants for unnecessary maintenance to ratchet up prices the head of the california public utilities commission asserted thursday puc president loretta lynch said her agency working with the state attorney general s office is probing patterns of plant outages that have created artificial shortages particularly when the state has issued emergency alerts because of seriously low levels of electricity there are instances where plants could have produced and they chose not to lynch said in an interview at the times and it is clear that there are instances that plants when called to produce chose not to produce even when they were obligated to do so under special contracts with the state and utility companies lynch said the ongoing investigation has already produced enough information for the puc and attorney general s office to take legal action against the generators next month the exact nature of that action she said is still under review lynch who is an attorney did not name specific suppliers or provide documentation of her assertions she said that information will remain confidential until court proceedings are undertaken generators have long denied any attempt at manipulating the power market in any unlawful way including orchestrating plant shutdowns they say the facilities are so old and have been run so hard during the power crisis that breakdowns are a recurring problem lynch and gov gray davis who has been particularly critical of out of state generators have not suggested that every plant shutdown has been unwarranted in fact the governor s top advisor on power plants released a statement last week saying inspectors determined that a bay area plant shutdown was justified and that the company s officials were accommodating state atty gen bill lockyer was not available for comment on his joint investigation with the puc a spokesman would only confirm that lockyer s office is investigating plant shutdowns as part of a wide ranging probe of possible civil and criminal violations so far the attorney general s office has subpoenaed documents in categories from generators including records of plant operations pricing practices and information the merchants may have shared with one another about california s power market we re looking for behavior that would violate antitrust or unfair business practice laws lockyer has told the times although he has not provided details of his office s findings he recently said the inquiry is beginning to get interesting lynch said evidence of allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns was amassed during interviews by investigators and in a review of the voluminous subpoenaed records obtained after intense legal battles with the power companies in addition investigators have been entering plants where unplanned shutdowns have occurred to examine operations and maintenance records lynch said at times the investigators have been denied access and have had to exert legal pressure to get in she said the plant shutdowns are a key factor in the soaring power prices which have gone from a megawatt hour in december to as high as last week i would argue it s no accident lynch said of the high prices that in fact it s due to the coordinated behavior of a cartel the power generators have repeatedly said they have acted within the rules of california s flawed deregulation program which allowed them to buy power plants formerly run by the state s three largest utilities gary ackerman a spokesman for a trade association of large power producers said lynch s allegations were the height of idiocy the reason many plants have been down in recent months he said is that power producers must perform maintenance now in anticipation of heavy summer demand he said he doubted that state investigators could prove wrongdoing because there was no conspiracy to turn off supplies my members do not make money by shutting down their plants so their competitors can make money said ackerman executive director of the western power trading forum state analysts have argued however that power traders can reap extraordinary profits by withholding power because the prices for the power that is sold are so high according to lynch investigators have found that some companies were more aggressive than others in allegedly using plant shutdowns to manipulate the state s power market she said investigators have also found a suspicious pattern when operators of the state electricity grid declare a stage alert meaning that electricity reserves have dropped below plants that do not need repairs suddenly are yanked offline that she said aggravates the shortages and the cost of wholesale electricity soars before december state analysts alleged that power traders had driven up prices primarily through bidding at the time the market was designed to pay all power suppliers the highest amount accepted by the state s grid operator that changed in december when new federal regulations restructured california s wholesale power market to loosen price controls lynch said since then a new pattern of plant shutdowns has emerged not coincidentally in my view she said now she added the state has endured historically high levels of unplanned plant outages the investigation is not focusing on power plants still operated by utility companies because they have not been going off line at record levels lynch said the california energy commission reported last week that the state s electrical grid has been sorely tested by plant shutdowns at a rate several times higher than in the last two years a times analysis of state data found that throughout the last two months about megawatts of production was offline more than a third of the peak power used in california on a typical day that has been about evenly divided between scheduled and sudden plant shutdowns by contrast shutdowns in the same period of and took only to megawatts offline last month the federal energy regulatory commission ordered electricity supplier williams energy marketing and trading to pay million in connection with allegations that plants were improperly shut down to raise prices the company agreed to settle the case without admitting any wrongdoing however ferc released a study in february of closures at three other california plants that it concluded were not undertaken to create a scarcity of power after talking to plant operators by telephone reviewing documents and visiting the three plants federal inspectors concluded that the companies appeared to have taken whatever steps were necessary to bring the generating facilities back online as soon as possible by accelerating maintenance and incurring additional expenses times staff writer nancy vogel in sacramento contributed to this story copyright los angeles times critics say bush proposal leaves california in the dark effect president s energy plan may not even offer a silver lining for the power deprived golden state by jenifer warren and robin fields times staff writers california lawmakers analysts and others waist deep in the state s power crisis reached a single conclusion thursday about the white house energy plan by the time many of president bush s proposals kick in it will be too late to do the golden state much good this plan does absolutely nothing to help california get through the next critical months groused state sen debra bowen d marina del rey you can t focus just on the long term here because the patient will be dead before we get the life support systems in place gov gray davis and others say the single best step bush could take to help the state is to impose controls on runaway electricity prices that are draining california s treasury and forcing massive utility rate increases instead the president has offered an energy blueprint anchored by an expansion in drilling for natural gas and oil increased reliance on nuclear power and more than billion in tax credits for conservation and energy development most of bush s proposals however are slow acting remedies and many others already are being applied in california which was hit by energy woes far ahead of other states the plan s dozens of incentive programs designed to boost output or promote conservation cannot be ramped up in time to protect the state from blackouts and painful spikes in electricity prices experts say overall the message in this plan is drop dead california said eric heitz of the energy foundation a san francisco based research and advocacy group i don t think it delivers another megawatt to california added loretta lynch president of the california public utilities commission state economic analysts say the plan fails california by viewing the power crisis as an ongoing emergency rather than a temporary one california s supply crunch should ease dramatically by summer once new power plants of them licensed in the pipeline start churning it s not that we don t have long term problems said stephen levy director of the palo alto based center for continuing study of the california economy it s just that energy isn t among them others including many environmentalists say bush could have made a noticeable impact by for example beefing up energy efficiency programs a quick clean and relatively inexpensive way to cut demand why not provide aggressive incentives rebates to get people to purchase more efficient air conditioners asked dan reicher assistant energy secretary in the clinton administration over the course of the year a program like that can make a dramatic difference because air conditioning consumes nearly one third of california s peak energy supply instead reicher noted bush earlier this year rolled back efficiency standards for air conditioners a move that critics say will require the country to build new power plants even the few elements of the plan that looked promising for california were clouded by doubt bush for example directed the energy secretary to explore ways to relieve a key transmission bottleneck known as path between northern and southern california but he specified that the upgrade which requires building a mile line at an estimated cost of million be funded by nonfederal contributions meaning the financially strapped utilities might be expected to bear the cost gov davis who lately has stepped up his pleas for help from washington said the bush plan offers too little too late for california and criticized the president for allowing the price gouging energy companies many of which reside in texas to get away with murder davis said the state is doing everything possible to build and conserve our way out of the problem but it desperately needs federal price controls on energy costs in california energy users spent about billion this year even with consumption down the bill could top billion but bush and vice president dick cheney who led the task force that prepared the plan are opposed to price caps preferring to let market forces reign davis said that laissez faire approach puts california s economy in peril just saying over the long haul everything will work out is turning a blind eye to the bleeding and hemorrhaging that exist in this state davis said small businesses literally will go out of business because they can t afford these rates analysts who studied the bush plan say they are particularly disappointed because it covers a lot of ground already plowed by california bush recommends building power plants over the next years about eight plants a month but california is already on a plant building spree that will give it a comfortable supply within two years the president also wants to streamline approval of plants and is pushing for a renewed commitment to nuclear power the california governor however has already ordered expedited licensing of new plants under an executive order issued in february there is little evidence meanwhile that californians are eager to approve an expansion in nuclear power nationwide not one new nuclear plant has been licensed in more than years and a times poll in february found that of californians oppose more nuclear reactors in the state you can barely build clean burning gas plants here let alone nuclear plants said edward kahn a san francisco based energy consultant with analysis group economics among other elements of the plan that could affect california is a proposal to allow federal authorities to take private land for power lines currently the u s government s power to forcibly acquire private property applies only to highways and gas pipelines expanding that power is likely to enrage property owners and property rights advocates who typically expect backing from bush style conservatives i m just surprised that this administration would want to preempt the state s authority over its own land said lynch of the puc the issue is already heated in california communities in southwestern riverside county have mobilized to resist san diego gas electric s attempts to use eminent domain to obtain private land for miles of transmission lines the legislature is considering a bill that would require state energy officials and utilities to grab public land first before reaching for private acreage bush also proposed a unified private national electricity grid an idea that seems at odds with southern california edison s effort to sell its transmission lines to the state but

we re building a super duper firetruck that will be ready five years from now times staff writers dan morain and richard simon and researcher patti williams contributed to this story wall st cautious over energy sector s outlook for next year stocks earnings for many oil and natural gas producers are expected to top out in as prices stabilize by josh friedman and tom petruno times staff writers president bush s energy plan unveiled thursday helped spark a broad rally across the energy sector and among firms that stand to benefit by selling equipment and services to oil and natural gas

big on the energy sector in early callahan took profits earlier this year we just don t see energy as a leader anymore its leadership days are done he said callahan shrugged off any potential windfalls from bush s proposal we look at these companies from the bottom up and pretty much ignore the macro trends he said for the near term investors have to cope with the prospect that earnings at

investment many alternative energy shares also rallied strongly in only to tumble municipal utilities seek exemptions from blackouts power those connected to state grid l a not among them say their customers should not be deprived to aid others by scott gold times staff writer a group of california cities that run their own electric utilities and have plenty of power to weather the energy crunch this summer will ask the federal government today to exempt them from blackouts their quiet campaign challenges the very foundation of the power grid in california and could change the dynamics of how electricity is doled out just as the state is bracing for a summer of rolling outages most californians pay large investor owned utilities like southern california edison co for power but about a quarter of households from the tiny desert city of needles to the state capital are billed for electricity by cities counties or local districts that run their own nonprofit utilities there are municipal utilities four of them serving los angeles burbank glendale and the imperial valley east of san diego are independent of the state power grid and do not face any outages but the others are required by contract to give electricity back to the california independent system operator which runs the grid by participating in rolling blackouts although they have plenty of power to serve their customers it makes them wonder why they went out and did their jobs said california municipal utilities assn attorney tony braun these utilities argue that they are suffering for the myopic decisions behind the deregulation of california s electricity market and the power shortage we believe our power was purchased for the citizens of riverside and that we don t have the right nor does anyone else to take it away from them when they need it said riverside utilities director tom evans our customers are being denied something that they are fundamentally entitled to leading the campaign is the tiny los angeles county city of vernon which filed a complaint last week asking the federal energy regulatory commission to exempt it from rolling blackouts vernon s public utility has customers all but of which are industrial operations such as glass manufacturers and meatpacking plants the city launched its own distribution system primarily to lure industry with electric rates that are typically among the lowest in the state said jorge somoano vernon s assistant director of resource management ferc set a deadline today for other municipal utilities to support the campaign up to half including riverside are expected to either file their own complaints or file documents supporting vernon said washington attorney bonnie blair who represents municipal utilities in azusa banning and colton even the campaign s supporters are unsure whether it will succeed blair acknowledged that there is no precedent for presenting this type of legal challenge to ferc which is expected to decide on the issue by mid june and she said municipal utilities might have a tough time proving they have done enough to insulate themselves from the energy crisis some cities with municipal utilities such as anaheim are not planning to join the campaign marcie edwards general manager of anaheim public utilities said the relationships between municipal utilities and cal iso are too complicated to make a clean break she said it is rare that a power shortage can be blamed entirely on the large investor owned utilities including this summer s energy crunch and until that can be proved she said municipal utilities still have an obligation to support california s power grid it s not right to go either way she said the fact remains that municipals still have an obligation to serve most of the municipal utilities are linked to the grid through agreements with cal iso that call for them to share electricity in an emergency those utilities tend to believe that the agreements were reserved for natural disasters such as earthquakes or other sudden and monumental problems such as a plane running into a transmission line the failure or inability of other utilities to schedule sufficient supplies vernon contended wryly in its papers filed with ferc does not constitute an emergency the obligation to share in rolling blackouts did not contemplate situations where some utilities were not meeting their basic obligation to provide resources to serve their customers blair said if they are forced to participate in rolling blackouts the effect is that the iso is taking energy that has been bought and paid for by some customers and effectively giving it to somebody else that has been unable to buy it jim detmers cal iso s vice president of operations said the organization plans to fight the campaign he said emergency provisions of cal iso s agreements with the municipal utilities cover the current energy crunch detmers said that exempting municipal utilities from blackouts would increase the share of those events shouldered by communities that do not have their own electricity distribution he compared the exemption request to a homeowner declining to fight a fire at a neighbor s because he wants to keep his water for himself what we re dealing with is an overall shortage detmers said we want to make sure that we are making the right choices when everyone s lives are at risk ronald nunnally edison s director of federal regulations and contracts said the municipal utilities have an obligation to uphold the integrity of the power grid to which they are connected the ability to use the grid requires to keep it whole if you will under all circumstances he said blair said those arguments don t hold up indeed she said the municipal utilities will argue that the california constitution expressly prohibits giving public property such as electricity bought by a municipal utility to a private enterprise such as investor owned electric companies our customers are paying for it she said that s the bottom line a united defense the big bad wolf of california s electric power crisis is the private power generators accused of manipulating the market to drive wholesale power rates into the stratosphere out of pure greed their pricing is insane but only the federal government can fix wholesale prices the bush administration refuses to do that leaving the state virtually helpless to deal with what many are now calling an energy cartel gradually however the state is arming itself in other ways to do battle with the big power bullies who appear more and more to have acted in concert to affect prices not as blatantly as the oil producers cartel opec but with even more dramatic results what is california considering a new state power agency could build and run its own plants lawmakers might as they are threatening impose a windfall profits tax the state could join with other pacific states in a buyers cartel that would simply refuse to purchase power if the price got too high the idea seems a bit desperate but it has a star wars allure to it and just might work the focus is on six big private companies they produce only about one fourth of the state s electricity but they are the ones that have power available when it is needed the most as the heat rises air conditioners go on and blackouts are threatened the private and municipal utilities naturally use their own power first then turn to the outside generators to meet additional demand the state has forked over billion to keep the lights on since the biggest private utilities went broke the cost of power has hit an obscene peak of nearly a megawatt hour charged by reliant energy of houston during a recent hot spell this price more than times the going rate a year ago prompted a furious gov gray davis to threaten to use his emergency powers to commandeer reliant s power or even seize one of its power plants no one is eager for the state to take over private power plants that smacks of dictatorship but if the generators can get away with charging so much during a brief hot spell in may what will the cost be in august the state is continues to investigate allegations that the six producers colluded to control the market or that they shut down plants to create a false shortage the state may take legal action next month however even that may not force prices down the buyers cartel has possibilities california would get oregon and washington to join in deciding the highest rate they are willing to pay for power this summer a price still providing the producers a generous profit if the generators wouldn t sell at that level the states would refuse to buy this would mean more blackouts for a time but the generators would be left with power they could not sell this extreme action would not be necessary of course if the federal energy regulatory commission accepted its responsibility under federal law and imposed a reasonable temporary cap on wholesale power prices that is not likely if the states are left to their own devices they can at least join forces then for a change let the seller beware search the archives of the los angeles times for similar

san francisco chronicle url n dtl type news washington vice president dick cheney in his most blunt and partisan assessment yet of california s energy crisis faulted democratic gov gray davis for failing to act quickly enough and called the state s purchase of nearly billion worth of energy a harebrained scheme cheney the administration s point man on energy issues went on a pair of sunday morning news shows to help sell a national energy plan that president bush proposed last week the discussion inevitably turned to california they ve bankrupted the biggest utility in the state destroyed the state s credit rating and squandered a significant portion of the state s financial surplus in a harebrained scheme to try to use the state to purchase power the vice president told tim russert of nbc s meet the press a spokesman for davis responded that the vice president s remarks yesterday were grossly misinformed and meant to divert attention from the administration s neglect of the state and its power woes the bush administration has refused to address california s problem and now they re washing their hands of it davis spokesman steve maviglio said the tit for tat remarks culminated a week that has seen an escalation in the war of words between the democratic governor and the republican white house the two administrations are increasingly engaging in a blame game as they confront a worsening crisis with enormous political stakes for both sides responding to critics including davis who say the white house has done little to help california the vice president pointed the finger back at the state s top democratic official they knew over a year ago they had a problem and gray davis refused to address that problem cheney said they kept putting it off and putting it off and putting it off with the notion that somehow price caps could be maintained now today where are they in california well rates are having to go up the puc just had to increase the rates themselves in california they ve got rolling blackouts they ve had some already they ll have them across the state this summer cheney said cheney s remarks referred to the state s purchases of almost billion worth of energy which began after the major utilities could no longer afford skyrocketing wholesale prices for energy earlier this month the democrat controlled california legislature approved a bill opposed by gop lawmakers to issue billion in bonds to repay the state s general fund to avoid making deep cuts in other state programs keeping the lights on that s the governor keeping the lights on maviglio said because of the failure of the federal government to act to impose price controls the state had to move to keep the lights on cheney s comments came just days after davis sharply criticized bush s energy plan saying it wouldn t help california consumers facing rising energy bills mr president you didn t create this problem but you are the only one who can solve it davis said in a letter released to the press with all due respect californians want to know mr president whether you re going to be on their side davis also suggested that by refusing to ask federal regulators for price caps bush was effectively allowing price gouging by oil and gas producers in his home state of texas cheney dismissed the allegation last week as goofy california a bad example in speeches on his energy plan the president has mostly used california as an example to the nation of what not to do he warned last week that the state s blackouts were a preview of what other states could face if the country doesn t boost energy supplies some california republican leaders have warned bush who will visit southern california later this month to soften the administration s rhetoric on the energy crisis to avoid being seen as unsympathetic to the state s plight cheney explained yesterday that the administration opposes even short term price controls because they could discourage energy suppliers from selling energy into california and building more plants in the state in the final analysis it s going to be the private sector s response that generates the power we re going to need long term cheney said the vice president did offer an olive branch to davis noting that both democratic and republican lawmakers approved the state s deregulation legislation precipitating the state s energy problems in fairness to governor davis the screwy regulatory scheme they put in place was supported on both sides of the aisle out there cheney said but he was the one who was in charge when it went haywire sen barbara boxer d calif who followed cheney on cbs face the nation yesterday morning put the blame back on the white house she recalled that president john f kennedy called steel company executives into his office when they were accused of price gouging she urged bush and cheney to do the same with energy suppliers you have the vice president sitting there sounding like

your smug friends and relatives back east mock california as an energy hog you can inform them that in fact we only use half as much electricity per capita as the rest of the united states a major reason prescient energy conservation rules developed under then gov jerry brown two decades ago according to veteran energy conservation scientist art rosenfeld widely ridiculed as governor moonbeam brown and the california energy commission thought it was wiser to develop tough energy conservation standards for buildings and appliances than to build new nuclear power plants and it turns out it was says rosenfeld a current member of the energy commission and former czar of energy conservation science at lawrence berkeley national laboratory which is funded mainly by the u s energy department undaunted by the changing political winds of the past three decades scientists at the lab have continued designing energy conserving technologies even though at first glance the new technologies don t look that exciting new lighting technologies witness for example the lamps being tested at the post office in rodeo the lamps are long thin tubes that aim light directly onto each carrier s mail sorting station rather than wastefully spreading it all over the place it s a simple innovation yet it reduces energy costs for lighting by up to percent lawrence berkeley researchers have calculated likewise they have recently invented a new type of high performance energy efficient table lamp that could greatly reduce the current power problems we have in california while increasing the quality of the lighting says researcher michael siminovitch of the berkeley lab the lamp consists of compact fluorescent lights that can be manipulated to direct light in different directions toward the ceiling for example that allows the users to fine tune lighting conditions to their precise needs overcoming common complaints about the dimness and poor design of first generation power saving lights the new lamps use only one fourth as much energy as a watt incandescent table lamp or a watt halogen lamp unveiled in march they are being field tested by the lab in collaboration with the sacramento municipal utility district smud southern california edison and pacific gas and electric light emitting diodes looking farther into the future the old fashioned incandescent light bulb may be challenged by electronic leds or light emitting diodes commonly used for vcrs and alarm clocks those dim little lights may eventually be made bright enough and white enough to begin replacing traditional lighting sources one problem the refraction or bending of light everyone has seen what happens when one inserts a straw into a glass of water the submerged portion of the straw appears to bend in the semiconductor materials used in leds much of the internally generated light is bent so much that it reflects back into the led that is it can t escape hence present leds don t emit enough light to attract a large commercial market however engineers at lawrence berkeley and elsewhere are designing new leds that would emit far more light one of them is physicist steve johnson who is confident that leds can eventually be made brighter than ordinary light bulbs he points out that colored leds are already used in some traffic lights by mixing together leds that emit different wavelengths of light one could create a white light emitting led johnson says white light is a mixture of all other optical wavelengths johnson maintains leds could make a difference to the energy bill one third of our energy used in commercial buildings goes into lighting those buildings so anything we do to reduce the lighting bill is going to help the energy crisis super efficient appliances all sorts of strategies are being tried in labs all over the country forget to turn off the iron before you drove out of town appliances that can be switched off remotely via computer modem are being developed by the media lab at mit as part of its kitchen sync project the same project is figuring out how to create electronically interconnected homes in which the appliances will switch themselves

a federally financed lab in ames iowa scientists there are using magnetic cooling methods to replace the compressed gases deployed by typical refrigerators physicists have long known that some materials get hotter when magnetized and cool off when demagnetized even today s refrigerators consume energy far more efficiently than they once did federal energy standards for refrigerators that took effect in july require that they burn only one fourth as much energy as did their predecessors years ago rosenfeld notes even better he adds modern refrigerators are bigger and don t use chlorofluorocarbons chemical compounds that are believed to damage the ozone layer which shields the earth from cancer causing ultraviolet radiation it s all just a matter of designing them properly

requirements for renewable energy installations including solar panels and wind devices energy is an issue on everybody s plate these days we want to make it easy for people to get their permits and get their panels said gary patton the city s deputy planning director oakland officials said they know of no other city taking similar steps to promote alternative energy generation although cities throughout the bay area and the state are increasingly looking to renewable energy sources san francisco for instance is considering placing solar energy bonds on the november ballot that would fund installation of solar panels on municipal property and could provide low cost loans for homeowners and businesses to do the same berkeley also is working on a loan program for renewable energy sources for residences the oakland measure which would remain in effect for two years also would apply to businesses interested in pursuing alternative energy generation as californians already hit by the state s energy crunch face the prospect of more rolling blackouts this summer oakland city officials are receiving a growing number of inquiries from residents interested in installing solar panels patton said the city also has heard complaints about the cost and time it now takes to get systems approved gary gerber president of sun light power in berkeley said he complained when he learned that it would cost more than to install a solar system on a home in the montclair area the project is on hold awaiting the new ordinance the process didn t really fit our situation it s pretty cumbersome and is the same type of process you might go through for a major remodel gerber said city officials responded beautifully in drafting a solar friendly policy he added calvin wong director of building services said the city has received a dozen applications for solar panel installations in the last month up from only a few applications before the energy crisis hit we anticipate a lot more he said gerber said he gets five to calls a day from interested customers he has done as much business in the first three months of this year as he did all of last year he said i don t think solar panels have been a significant issue for oakland up to now said councilman dick spees who backs the proposed change we want to encourage it by making it simple direct and less costly oakland also is exploring installing solar panels on city buildings a household solar unit which can heat water or produce electricity directly can cost to although state rebates can reduce the price by half president bush s energy plan released last week proposes a percent tax credit for residents who install solar panels patton said the main target of oakland s emergency ordinance was solar panels but it would apply to other renewable energy production facilities including those using wind and water currently design review for such installations can cost between and and take between three and eight weeks depending on a property s location under the proposal design review would be waived once an owner submits drawings to the city showing that the equipment installation meets certain requirements such as matching the pitch of a sloped roof or if freestanding being no taller than feet for certain structures such as designated landmark sites design review still would be required but at no cost and lasting no

independent system operator monitor in chief of california s energy grid they have a new job responding to more than detailed subpoenas the data the iso keeps on electricity transactions are central to the half dozen investigations initiated by state and federal agencies into various parts of the state s energy mess including possible criminal activity by power generators they re asking for everything and then some a spokeswoman for the iso stephanie mccorkle said sighing the federal energy regulatory commission the state public utilities commission the assembly the senate the state attorney general and a phalanx of state and federal auditors all are boring into california s energy mess the main thrust of the most significant investigations is the conduct of power generators that have reaped record profits selling electricity to the electron starved state although most investigators say the iso s logs and bid records show the various generators used their market share to drive up prices the issue is whether they did so acting collaboratively either directly or indirectly generators deny any manipulation of the market they say their prices simply reflect a lack of supply plant breakdowns and the high cost of natural gas but that hasn t stopped the state from trying to prove them wrong attorney general bill lockyer has been probing the actions of the generators since august to see if they manipulated the market or engaged in unfair business practices or if their executives engaged in criminal behavior we all feel we ve been taken advantage of been gouged lockyer said the question is whether it s legal greed or illegal greed there s no question it s greed lockyer is in court fighting energy companies like reliant energy inc and dynegy which have refused to disclose internal company information that lockyer subpoenaed feb the power companies say they are not receiving assurances the documents lockyer wants will be kept confidential lockyer said he hopes to complete his spadework on the generators this summer the puc also is probing whether generators timed maintenance and shutdowns to drive up prices on thursday puc president loretta lynch said investigators found patterns of plant shutdowns that created artificial shortages lockyer insisted that no one yet has sufficient evidence to win a civil or criminal suit but we re probably further along than any other investigative effort generators say they are cooperating with the investigations except for worries about proprietary information becoming public and flatly reject the notion they have been gaming the market or acting in concert we naturally would take serious issue with some of those allegations said richard wheatley a spokesman for reliant energy in houston it doesn t compute because we all compete against each other we don t cooperate share information or anything of that nature it s not only illegal but unethical to do so said chuck griffin a mirant corp spokesman any patterns would exist because of the rules they established long before mirant was in california a new investigation of the generators is being done also by the aptly named senate select committee to investigate price manipulation in the wholesale energy market it too is meeting resistance from generators in handing over documents they consider confidential discussions thus far in that regard have been disturbing and right now we re at an impasse said sen joe dunn d santa ana the committee s chairman dunn s committee can only gather facts and make recommendations on new laws if it uncovers some kind of anti competitive activity not already covered by the law so far the federal energy regulatory commission is the only entity to impose any economic pain on generators after a probe of california s power market last summer the commission issued an order in december that created a mechanism by which generators would have to justify prices above a certain level determined by the commission in march the commission said generators had to justify million in charges or reimburse the money it also reached an million settlement with aes southland and williams energy marketing trading over power plants that were supposed to be running but weren t critics from gov gray davis down say that generators owe many millions more in refunds several other investigations are either

imperiling california s economy i urge you to stand up to your friends in the energy business and exercise the federal government s exclusive responsibility to ensure energy prices are reasonable said davis california consumer advocates and utility officials alike endorsed the call for rate caps bush has rejected such caps although in his radio address yesterday he noted that the average family energy bill has climbed by percent over the past three years that s a hardship for every family he said we need to act to protect family budgets his prescription however was not for restricting how much energy producers can charge but for increasing energy production by building more power plants and drilling for oil in alaska s arctic national wildlife refuge yesterday bush put into action by executive order two of his recommendations including ordering federal agencies to speed permit approvals for new plant and pipeline construction still other proposals such as tax credits for hybrid vehicle purchases will require congressional action it s time to leave behind rancorous old arguments and build a positive new consensus bush said in the radio address with new technology sound regulation and plain good sense we can expand our energy production while protecting the environment last spring davis said california was paying an average of for a megawatt of power by last week the price had spiked to nearly per megawatt what s going on here pure and simple is unconscionable price gouging by the big energy producers most of them incidentally located in texas he said davis criticized bush s argument that limiting energy prices will deter producers from increasing the supply of energy that s as ridiculous as saying we need to pay dairies a gallon to motivate them to produce milk he said pacific gas and electric co officials said they are pleased with bush s emphasis on increasing electricity and natural gas generation and his call for improving energy efficiency but a prepared statement by pg e went on we continue to believe that the federal energy regulatory commission must stabilize the western market this summer through circuit breakers price caps or cost based rates mindy spatt spokeswoman for the utility reform network a san francisco based consumer advocacy group said davis must realize bush is not going to implement price caps in the absence of federal action the governor needs to take action himself said spatt he could take plants by the power of eminent domain impose an excess profits tax on energy producers or start a buyers cartel where western states get together and refuse to pay over a certain price for electricity davis should take his own advice to the president and stand up to these energy companies the state has spent billion

political advertising more than months before elections but the move was clearly intended to exploit consumer anger over rising prices and rolling blackouts chronicle news services contributed to this report e mail tyche hendricks at thendricks sfchronicle com power juggling ramped up price insiders say manipulation also strained equipment christian berthelsen scott winokur chronicle staff writers sunday may san francisco chronicle url n dtl type news large power companies have driven up electricity prices in california by throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages according to dozens of interviews with regulators lawyers and energy industry workers those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns that are depriving the state of much needed electricity the accounts are supported by an independent review of shutdown data by the chronicle the california energy commission calculates that an average of megawatts of generating capacity nearly a third of the state s total was unavailable each day in april because of plant shutdowns more than four times as much as a year ago such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as california enters another period of high demand the warm spring and summer months of may to september when electricity usage normally grows by a third loretta lynch president of the california public utilities commission said last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant shutdowns and the california independent system operator which manages the state s power grid says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of constricting supply but an extensive investigation by the chronicle has found that not only were generators shut down to boost prices but these gaming tactics contributed to the plants deteriorating condition we suspected it said jim macintosh the manager of grid operations for the iso it was a sure factor in driving up prices such swings in unit output he said would only make sense in a scenario when they re trying to game something otherwise why would they do that they re tearing their units up unusual phone calls operators at a san bernardino county power plant owned by reliant energy inc say a complex plan to manipulate the california energy market began early last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the company s headquarters in houston according to the accounts of three plant operators reliant s operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease then increase output at the megawatt etiwanda plant this happened as many as four or five times an hour each time the units were ramped down and electricity production fell plant employees watched on a control room computer screen as spot market energy prices rose then came the phone call to ramp the units back up they would tell us what to do and we would do it said one of the men who only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear being fired afterward we would just sit there and watch the market change the workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a number of california power plants just as the state s power crisis began in earnest the workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market it appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading floors in houston rather than the reliability needs of the iso said carl wood a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that agency s investigation into plant outages instead of being responsive to demands for reliability they re responsive to demands for profitability corporate denial reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism to game the california energy market they and other power companies including aes corp and a partnership between nrg energy inc and dynegy inc have asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet california s needs while acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as frequently as every minutes company officials said it was done at the instructions of the iso to maintain supply demand balance as a part of routinely doing business within california and the california market design we are required to do that said kevin frankeny an operations official with reliant when the iso issues dispatch orders they dispatch on a minute basis it can go up and down many times within an hour frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which reliant schedulers in houston ordered dispatch changes without the iso directing them to do it first the iso refused to comment on operations at any specific facility but stephanie mccorkle an iso spokeswoman said the ramping tactics were used beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply and one of the plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid managers iso was not calling reliant every minutes for that said one of the operators not for an individual unit officials with the california attorney general s office declined to comment on the legality of the ramping practice citing a continuing investigation into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated one source familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping if proved to have been done to drive up prices could violate the state s unfair business practices laws invisible practice how could companies such as reliant tinker with output and not get caught one of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually invisible to regulators and grid operators when power companies bid on hourly contracts they agree to produce a certain amount of electricity over the given hour generators are paid based on an average of the spot market prices for that hour by driving up the spot price they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total amount of energy required the plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after their output measurement which was performed at the top of each hour by the iso then he said it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity rose in response to the reduced output by the time the iso measured again the output was back at the expected level another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down that if the price reached a satisfactory level generators would raise output and remain at that level as long as the price was right other times if the price was low output was brought down and kept down the same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of individual will of the company schedulers in houston with some being more aggressive than others what they would do especially late at night is if the price tanked they would undergenerate an operator said then mysteriously the price would go up then if the schedule was at required megawatt hours of output they d say go up to that would cause the price to tank and they d say bring it down again rapid changes these fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as to minutes the operators said but acceptable rates for bringing a unit from minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by southern california edison were more like minutes to avoid stressing the machinery one of the workers said moreover they were typically run at constant levels which also reduced wear and tear they were basically ramping up as fast as they can and then slamming the brakes on said one of the operators they were increasing the fatigue on the units iso officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on gaming tactics including instituting a so called minute market rather than the hourly market so that it could be more easily detected when companies were withholding power but the iso says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in driving up energy prices a computer analysis by the chronicle of shutdown data over a recent day period shows reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of plant shutdowns reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage lost among those companies plants owned by reliant aes mirant corp and duke energy inc accounted for more than half of the state s unplanned shutdowns even though their generating capacity was no more than percent of the state s total capacity from all sources reliant one of california s largest and most profitable out of state generators reported shutdowns during the period in march and april it was followed by mirant corp of atlanta aes corp of arlington va and duke energy north america of charlotte n c reliant s unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than megawatts over the day period an average of per day enough power for million homes for one hour its ormond beach plant in oxnard with one generating unit down for days accounted for more than of those missed megawatts however an operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the result of legitimate equipment failures reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of repair they are old at etiwanda is the oldest of reliant s five california plants and the company says routine maintenance was deferred so the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand but the operators said the issue is not so clear cut one problem at etiwanda a tube leak had been present for about a month and was previously reported to management they said but it had not deteriorated much it was operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit offline because of the problem moreover at the time of the shutdown the iso had expressly asked reliant to keep the unit online the operators said richard wheatley a spokesman for reliant denied that any reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary maintenance ramping may be rampant sources say reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice a source familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs obtained from aes alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations and an operator who has worked at the el segundo plant co owned by nrg and dynegy said the practice was used there although less frequently the scheduling calls came from dynegy s trading floor in houston rather than nrg in minneapolis he said steve stengel a spokesman for dynegy said changes in output at el segundo were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day and denied the company was engaged in gaming the california market in a may report the california energy commission cited reliant s etiwanda plant as well as the alamitos and el segundo plants as some of the major beneficiaries of high real time prices that spring one way to obtain those high prices the plant workers said was the simple method of demanding a sky high price and refusing to deliver power if that price was not met on one occasion one operator said reliant ordered a unit at etiwanda to be shut off because the iso would not meet the price of per megawatt hour even though the legal price cap at the time was the operator said it s our unit shut it off the source said e mail christian berthelsen at cberthelsen sfchronicle com and scott winokur at swinokur sfchronicle com grid officials others studying planned blackouts posted at a m pdt monday may by jennifer coleman associated press writer sacramento ap could californians be waking up to hear a weather report a pollen count and an electricity blackout forecast it s not out of the question say some lawmakers i actually think it s a thoughtful plan to give folks an opportunity to understand the likelihood of blackouts on a daily basis assemblyman fred keeley d boulder creek the assembly s point man on energy keeley compared it to weather forecasting to be able to look at the next three or four days have a percentile about the likelihood of blackouts the independent system operator keeper of the state s power grid is expected to release a report monday detailing how such a plan would work the idea is to provide a lot of information so people can make choices to live with blackouts on a temporary basis this summer keeley said peter navarro a university of california irvine economics professor released a report last month with a consumer group that recommends the state set a price limit on what they ll pay for power and if generators don t lower the price the state should schedule blackouts to cut consumption he said the report by navarro and the utility consumers action network says the state s current method of highly disruptive random rolling blackouts needs to be revamped ucan suggests that the state be divided into blackout zones that utilities could notify ahead of time that power would be cut at a specific time and for a certain duration scheduling blackouts could attract criminals to outage areas keeley acknowledged and possibly could subject the state to legal liability for traffic accidents or other incidents if power is deliberately shut off that is a genuine problem and genuine concern keeley said i think we would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources appropriately critics of the planned blackouts said power producers simply could sell their unused electricity to other states or trim back production to keep supplies short assemblyman mike briggs r fresno plans to introduce a bill this week that would have the public utilities commission notify businesses and homeowners as much as one month ahead of time when they would have their power cut we owe the people of this state some kind of schedule briggs said if businesses and individuals knew what days their power could potentially be shut off or blacked out they could plan for that blackout accordingly the central valley republican said the ability to plan for outages would be especially benefit farmers who need power to irrigate their crops assembly speaker robert hertzberg who convened a special subcommittee on blackouts has also suggested the state should consider scheduling daily blackouts to cut the state s power use and drive down prices democratic assembly members plan to introduce their own version of a blackout plan sen debra bowen d marina del rey has said she envisions giving consumers three to five days notice that their power will be cut during a particular period so businesses could opt to shut down or shift their operations to nonpeak hours such as nights and weekends and by treating blackouts as a first option rather than a last resort the state could cut its peak power needs and drive down prices bowen said california power consumers would in essence form a reverse cartel to stop the market manipulation and the price gouging she said the planned blackout suggestions come as state officials grow increasingly concerned that power prices will keep rising this summer even beyond the extraordinary levels the state already has been paying on behalf of three cash strapped privately owned utilities gov gray davis said the state paid per megawatt hour at one point last week the state has dedicated billion since mid january to purchase power for pacific gas and electric southern california edison and san diego gas and electric those expenditures will be repaid this summer when the state issues billion in revenue bonds the bonds will be repaid by ratepayers over years planning ahead for blackouts business services plan for summer crises by lois evezich aliso viejo news no sooner did aliso viejo become the newest city in orange county than california was hit with an energy crisis threatening rolling blackouts across the community energy issues have already taken a priority with the council elect and the city manager we ve had some meetings to familiarize ourselves with the situation said interim city manager william woollett we ve hired an engineering firm to take a look at what kind of organization we need and what kind of budget we must have for this issue woollett added that they haven t done anything specific yet as aliso viejo is not a formal city until july hilary mcallister head librarian at the aliso viejo branch of the orange county public library said all the branches have a plan we plan to continue checking out books only doing the work by hand as long as it is safe safety is the main issue and if that is a concern we might have to close branches in the library system received instructions said mcallister and much of what they decide will have to do with how much warning time they have we re hoping the power company will warn us she said the library at journey has been exempt from blackouts so far even when other areas in aliso viejo were hit mcallister isn t sure if that has anything to do with their location right across the street from the fire station fluor corporation with a large facility in aliso viejo which houses employees in its corporate headquarters and the five building campus a block away is well prepared for a blackout according to lorie serrato media representative we even have blackout kits for the elevators said serrato they include bottled water snacks and flashlights she didn t know if there were also tranquilizers included for those who are claustrophobic we re getting used to taking the stairs she said and we re learning to save our work on computers more often that s important barnes noble experienced a blackout this winter for safety reasons customers were asked to gather at the front of the store and business went on though not as usual customers who knew what books they wanted to buy asked employees to find them and sales were registered on calculators for safety reasons customers were not allowed where there was not adequate light barnes noble has cut lights in the back room to save energy and set the air conditioners to slightly higher temperatures wendy mortensen skating school director at the ice chalet at journey said we ve been told that we are on the same power grid as the sheriff s substation and the fire department and that we won t lose power mortensen said that in minutes not much would happen to the ice and if there is a blackout there is enough light during the day we are only running half the lights said mortensen and we keep the offices and the hallways dark to conserve energy united parcel service is tight lipped about conservation measures they consider it proprietary information as the measures give them a competitive edge overall the company said they can work during blackouts though it takes a little longer the facility does not have much activity during the peak energy hours but if it should happen during heavy work loads the facility can transfer the work to other shifts or to another ups facility ups in aliso viejo is part of the edison beat the peak program designed to help companies conserve and prepare the facility has motion sensors in the offices and all employees have flashlights and other equipment as a safety precaution kmart was awarded a million grant from the california energy commission in february it used some of that money to retrofit the aliso viejo store with energy conserving store lights that reduce consumption by percent the project is still under way with expected completion in the next several weeks kmart also has uninterruptible power sources it uses as backups in case there is a blackout these backups provide minutes worth of energy used for the pharmacy and the cash registers in the event of a blackout the store would close for new customers but could still service the customers already in the store is price gouging root of crisis the president is allowing the price gouging energy companies many of whom reside in texas to get away with murder gov gray davis said on thursday in response to a george w bush energy plan that doesn t call for caps on the price of electricity sold by out of state generators to california this remark captured the essence of the davis approach to the energy problems blame everybody else call for government price controls even though they historically have reduced the supply of energy and use divisive and even conspiratorial rhetoric on the same day governor davis was blasting the bush energy plan his appointee who runs the public utilities commission loretta lynch told a newspaper that power generators purposefully keep their plants idle to jack up prices attorney general bill lockyer said that he found evidence of what ms lynch called artificial shortages we re interested in seeing the evidence of course but it looks suspiciously like politicians are using the power gouging theory as a way to bluster rather than come up with concrete solutions it also is a way for those who are ideologically hostile to deregulation perhaps cynical of business and capitalism in general to demonize merchant generators and pave the way for a government takeover no doubt wholesale electricity prices have skyrocketed prices zoomed from a megawatt hour late last year to nearly last week according to the san francisco chronicle the newspaper reports that plant shutdowns are a cause of the price spike yet a number of analysts have found the price gouging theory to be dubious a dow jones newswire column analyzed federal energy regulatory commission data on the amount of forced outages over the past two summers yes there were nearly four times as many plant closures by plants owned by five big producers in summer than in summer but as writer mark golden pointed out outages for all plants including municipally owned ones and small qualifying facilities that have no incentive to game the system were percent higher in summer than in summer the writer notes that four of the big are either constructing big new generators in california or have applied for permits to do so that would seem to fly in the face of a withholding strategy an april paper co authored by william hogan a professor at the john f kennedy school of government at harvard university could not prove there wasn t manipulation but explained it is unlikely to be the dominant factor and may not even be significant the bigger issue the hogan paper argued is the seriously flawed restructuring system that caused the electricity market collapse t he principal policy focus should be on fashioning workable solutions for the other more serious problems in the market design that relate to the underlying causes of the market meltdown other analysts argue that to whatever degree price gouging has taken place it is solely the fault of the retail price caps and other government rules that have distorted the market the large number of shutdowns has not been the result of any conspiracy the power generators say but the result of needed maintenance on facilities that have been overworked many of these are older plants that require more shutdowns for maintenance than new ones people can invest money in various different markets jan smutny jones told us he is executive director of the independent energy producers association in sacramento which represents qfs and merchant generators with politically charged hearings demonization of power generators proposals for excess profits taxes and threats of seizing property made by california democrats he said generators may conclude that california is a dangerous place to invest gov davis said the bush plan won t add any new electrical power but neither will davis grandstanding about price gougers in fact it may even dissuade electricity investment the governor needs to apply his will it create new power standard to his own rhetoric then get busy leading the state out of this mess generator could help during future energy shortages city is the first field trial customer for low emission device by annalisa burgos anaheim bulletin anaheim has taken several innovative measures to secure reliable power sources for its customers one such measure approved unanimously by the city council on april is to be the first field trial customer for indiana based cummins inc and vancouver based westport innovations inc s joint venture megawatt low emissions natural gas power generator the anaheim convention center will test the westport natural gas fuel injection technology on a cummins qsk litre diesel engine generator the technology allows diesel engines to operate on natural gas reducing emissions and allowing longer hours of operation up to hours per year compared to hours per year from other generators public utilities is always looking for new environmentally efficient technologies spokeswoman melanie nieman said the generator will not be installed until this fall which means it will not be available to help during this summer s power crisis but officials believe it will be a valuable asset the cummins westport generator provides much needed electricity that meets environmental regulations and during peak periods can produce power for less than the market cost of power general manager marcie edwards said the use of such onsite generators enables us to respond to customer needs while reducing california s system demand the generator will provide off site distributed generation that will be able to supplement anaheim s utility grid with power that may be called upon during state power emergencies or when the cost of wholesale market power is high anaheim gets percent of its energy supply from long term power generation contracts and percent on the daily wholesale market in addition the generator can provide about percent of the center s energy load and will serve as a source of backup emergency power westport spokesman alan bayless said california s energy shortage made it an ideal location to test the new technology nieman said the city chose the convention center because it needed extra backup for its expansion energy saving measures implemented by theresa salinas the orange county register stanton city manager terry matz said that energy saving measures have been implemented at city hall including the installation of light sensors that turn the lights on when people enter a room the city also has received a grant from southern california edison to replace current traffic signals with energy saving diode lights matz said the city is also looking at the possibility of equipping major intersections with battery back up systems to keep signal lights functioning matz said that he is requesting be set aside in the budget to purchase new emergency generators for the civic center calif utilities make accusation los angeles ap via newsedge corporation there is evidence that a cartel of power companies shut down plants for unnecessary maintenance to increase energy prices the head of the california public utilities commission said an energy official called the allegation idiocy puc president loretta lynch told the los angeles times on thursday that her agency and the state attorney general s office are probing plant outages that she said created artificial shortages that contributed to skyrocketing power prices there are instances where plants could have produced and they chose not to lynch said and it is clear that there are instances that plants when called to produce chose not to produce she said that happened even when plants were obligated to do so under special contracts with utility companies and the state gary ackerman executive director of the western power trading forum dismissed lynch s allegations as the height of idiocy power generators have repeatedly said they have been acting within the rules of the state s deregulation system the reason many plants have been down in recent months ackerman said is that power producers must perform maintenance now in anticipation of heavy summer demand my members do not make money by shutting down their plants so their competitors can make money said ackerman who represents a trade association of large power producers but lynch said the probe has produced enough information for the puc and attorney general to take legal action next month against some power generators she did not identify them and the exact nature of the legal action is still under review she said investigators conducted interviews and reviewed subpoenaed records obtained after legal battles with the power companies to gather evidence of allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns lynch said power plants where unplanned shutdowns have happened also were visited to examine operations and maintenance records lynch said power prices have gone from a megawatt hour in december to as much as last week and plant shutdowns have been a key factor in the soaring prices i would argue it s no accident lynch said that in fact it s due to the coordinated behavior of a cartel lynch said one suspicious pattern has emerged when operators of the state s electricity grid declared a stage alert which means that electricity reserves had dipped below percent plants that didn t need repairs were suddenly pulled off line pg e targets business customers for energy reduction utility steps up efforts to encourage conservation awaits more state funding san francisco business wire may via newsedge corporation in conjunction with its customer education campaign called the more you know about conserving energy the less energy you need pacific gas and electric company has stepped up its efforts to update business customers on the energy crisis and provide tools to help them conserve energy especially in the coming months when power shortages are likely the utility is also working with state officials to determine how best to use the additional funding for conservation and energy efficiency which is contained in sb x signed into law by governor davis on april the california independent system operator has forecast power shortages of to megawatts between now and the end of summer shortages that significant may result in blackouts for millions of californians with little new generation available in time for summer peak use along with a continuing reduction of hydroelectric power from the pacific northwest californians must adopt rigorous energy conservation habits if outages are to be minimized the energy crisis has taken its toll on all of us with higher energy costs and blackouts but we recognize that our business customers are especially hurt because they use a lot of electricity and outages not only mean a loss of productivity but can damage expensive sensitive equipment said bev alexander pacific gas and electric company vice president over energy management programs since businesses account for about half of customer electricity consumption their efforts to conserve have a great impact on statewide energy use so we want them to utilize all the tools available to reduce their energy use pacific gas and electric company offers advice and incentives to help consumers make their businesses more energy efficient rebates are available for installing more efficient lighting hvac refrigeration and other mechanical equipment the utility has budgeted million for business energy management programs in the funding comes from ratepayers via the public purpose programs charge on all customers utility bills and is not impacted by the company s chapter proceedings in addition pacific gas and electric company has proposed to the cpuc how it could spend approximately million to support business related energy efficiency programs from sb x funds which set aside million in taxpayer dollars to encourage residential and non residential energy conservation the utility also is encouraging customers to take simple steps such as turning off lights and equipment and adjusting thermostats to reduce the air conditioning load on a hot summer day percent of california s energy use is air conditioning and commercial lighting alexander said for example if commercial office buildings turned out every other light and set their thermostats to degrees we could save roughly megawatts or the equivalent of seven large power plants measures like these could virtually prevent blackouts this summer to educate business customers on the energy crisis and steps they can take the utility holds informational workshops throughout its service area sends newsletters includes bill inserts utilizes paid advertising the internet and news stories business customers can obtain information about energy efficiency

guy matthews the wall street journal page a copyright c dow jones company inc pittsburgh the list of victims of california s botched power deregulation plan keeps growing when california s electricity shortage surfaced last fall it caused spot prices of electricity to skyrocket all along the west coast some aluminum companies profited by temporarily closing their massive smelters in the pacific northwest and selling back their electricity to the spot market or to the bonneville power administration the region s biggest power provider the aluminum industry which produces nearly of the nation s output in the states of oregon washington and montana commands a huge amount of electricity enough to power seattle daily closing the smelters freed up a lot of power and significantly reduced bonneville s reliance on the electricity spot market but bonneville now wants the smelters in the region to stay closed for two years business executives economists and union leaders are just now assessing the economic impact of the plan and for the most part things don t look good for the small pacific northwest towns whose livelihoods revolve around aluminum for the aluminum companies closing plants isn t such a bad thing at least in the short term besides getting a big chunk of cash from bonneville the closures will cut nearly of the world s aluminum smelting capacity alcoa inc pittsburgh the world s leading aluminum producer says it s closing its ferndale wash smelter idling metric tons or of its annual capacity with that much aluminum off the market prices once expected to drop amid a slowing economy have instead firmed and are expected to rise pechiney sa of france the world s third largest aluminum maker expects prices to jump at least by the end of the year as a result of supply side bottlenecks current spot prices for aluminum hover around cents a pound alcan inc of montreal the second largest aluminum maker in the world says it expects more growth and better profits from many of its operations including its specialty packaging business rolling mills and production of primary aluminum meanwhile producers in india said they plan to take advantage of the bottleneck in the u s by boosting exports outside the pacific northwest existing smelters in the u s are pretty much operating at capacity says michael f gambardella metals analyst for j p morgan securities inc the problems in the pacific northwest have kept aluminum prices relatively stable despite the current period of weak demand for aluminum the icing on the cake will be when the u s economy starts to recover you will see aluminum prices skyrocket for companies using aluminum as a raw material rising prices may become another burden just as labor and energy costs and dwindling revenue damp profits but the biggest victims will be the rural towns in the pacific northwest whose economies have relied on aluminum since after the great depression when the u s government supplied cheap power to run smelers in hopes of easing high unemployment economists believe that if aluminum plants close for two years they will likely stay closed operating aluminum smelters isn t like opening or closing a eleven it costs a lot of money to shut the metal making operations down and then even more money to reboot the entire operation this is why aluminum smelters and similar factories run hours a day additionally the way that the smelting operations are configured aluminum companies rack up losses if the plants operate at low capacities and remaining open isn t much of an option after bonneville signaled that power rates will rise sharply in october when current contracts with the aluminum companies expire sharply higher rates will make aluminum production unprofitable for now alcoa said it will not immediately lay off the employees at the shuttered ferndale plant primarily because bonneville agreed to reimburse alcoa for employee wages and benefits still the news of plant closings is sending shock waves through communities such as goldendale wash a small town on the banks of the columbia river together goldendale aluminum co and northwest aluminum co employ about people more than one third of the immediate area s working population those aluminum jobs pay about a year in salary and benefits the jobs created by these industries are the lifeblood of our communities says mark sigfrinius goldendale s mayor they cannot be written off to ease the pain bonneville is hoping that it can strike a deal so that the aluminum makers in the region will take payments received for shutting down and use that money either to retrain the work force or to provide a lump sum payment to help them make it through the two years but the united steelworkers of america representing workers in the affected oregon montana and washington region says that its skilled work force would probably just leave the region and find work elsewhere under the bpa plan the union is jumping up and down about this says david foster a negotiator for the union we intend to make absolutely sure that money comes to the union workers two years is a long time,Data

shares of enron corp and dynegy inc both rose in heavy trading as investors began trying to digest the possible risks and rewards of dynegy s plan to acquire enron in a stock swap with a current value of billion in calls and meetings with analysts yesterday dynegy chairman chuck watson and enron chairman kenneth lay continued talking up the deal that was announced late friday we are confident this is good strategically and financially for dynegy and enron said mr watson who will serve as chairman and chief executive of the combined entity to be called dynegy inc while the proposed combination faces months of review by government agencies and gives dynegy possible opportunities to cancel the deal investors initial reaction to the merger announcement was positive as of p m in new york stock exchange composite trading dynegy shares were at up or also on the big board enron was at up or cents both companies were among the most actively traded issues under terms of the proposed acquisition dynegy would give of its shares for each enron share based on dynegy s stock price yesterday this formula values enron stock at each enron has about million shares outstanding some people raised cautionary notes yesterday moody s investors service placed dynegy on review for a possible credit ratings downgrade standard poor s made a similar move on friday moody s said that while it saw positive elements to the proposed combination it also believed the financial and business risks associated with the transaction could negatively impact dynegy s credit fundamentals prudential securities analyst carol coale who counts herself a fan of dynegy also worries that enron s enormous problems could be a drag on the combined entity i don t want the dynegy folks to get into something that s not good for the company she said as reported enron in the past several weeks has seen its stock price and standing in the investment community plummet largely as the result of large scale transactions it did with partnerships headed by enron officers those transactions have produced hundreds of millions of dollars of write offs and restatements in the past month they are being investigated by the securities and exchange commission and have helped spawn more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits copyright dow jones company inc all rights reserved business financial desk section c market place gas pipeline is prominent as dynegy seeks enron by floyd norris the new york times page column c new york times company dynegy has negotiated a great takeover and it may end up buying enron too as part of its planned acquisition of enron dynegy will get the crown jewel even if the overall deal falls apart in return for its billion investment today dynegy has the right to acquire northern natural gas a pipeline system that is probably worth more as dynegy stock soared percent yesterday enron s lagged behind rising just percent page c that widened the spread the profit a trader could lock in by buying enron and selling dynegy short assuming the deal goes through to percent the big premium probably reflects more than the fact that this deal will not close for many months it is at least a possibility that dynegy will renegotiate the price or even walk away as it learns more about enron s business not that chuck watson chairman and chief executive of dynegy was threatening to do any such thing in a talk to analysts yesterday and in a later interview he was extraordinarily upbeat about enron s trading business even as he dismissed many of the company s diversifications as failures whose poor performance might have been obscured by fancy accounting full details of the agreement between the companies will not be known until the merger agreement is filed with the securities and exchange commission today or tomorrow but it appears that if the agreement falls apart for any reason dynegy has the right to keep the pipeline without putting up any additional cash speaking to analysts yesterday rob doty chief financial officer at dynegy said the company was paying about seven or eight times the cash flow of the pipeline business walking away from the deal might cost dynegy million if it could not cite any material adverse change in enron s business as provided in the merger agreement but one way to look at this deal is that dynegy is spending billion for the pipeline and a right to get the rest of enron on the agreed terms mr watson said he was confident that things would not go wrong we have comfort there is not another shoe to drop he said if there is no shoe this is a phenomenally good transaction in presentations to analysts dynegy officials said they expected the company s earnings per share to grow by at least cents a year even before considering cost reductions as the two businesses are merged that arithmetic was based on assumptions that enron could deliver at least percent of the a share in pro forma earnings that wall street had been forecasting for next year those forecasts had stayed the same even as enron s business collapsed the bullish case for the merger is that enron s real profits were there and that the financial maneuvering did not cover up far deeper problems mr watson promised that more details would be disclosed about the partnerships that were created by enron and traded with it providing a substantial part of the company s profits in enron s need to make a deal quickly almost any deal was emphasized by standard poor s the bond rating service in a conference call yesterday ron barone an analyst with s p said that without the takeover enron s rating would have been cut to low bb or high b those ratings are not even at the high end of junk and a company like enron which depends on others being willing to treat it as a trusted trading partner needs an investment grade rating its current s p rating is bbb minus the lowest investment grade rating that means enron could not continue as an independent business and it means that should dynegy decide to renegotiate enron would be in a very poor bargaining position unless it had another bidder copyright dow jones company inc all rights reserved business financial desk section c the markets suitor for enron receives approval from wall st by alex berenson the new york times page column c new york times company wall street found nothing but good news in dynegy s billion takeover of the enron corporation yesterday three days after dynegy an energy marketing and trading company based in houston agreed to take over enron its giant crosstown rival dynegy executives came to new york to assure investors that the deal would sharply increase their company s profits they met a receptive audience dynegy stock closed yesterday at up or percent since last wednesday when news of a possible takeover emerged dynegy s stock has risen more than one third enron closed at up cents or percent after some initial uncertainty about the takeover investors appear to have accepted dynegy s view that the deal will give it a lucrative franchise in trading natural gas and electricity enron s stock fell almost percent in the weeks leading up to the deal as enron said it had overstated its earnings by almost million since and forced out several top executives but chuck watson dynegy s chairman told investors repeatedly yesterday that enron s problems were mainly a result of failed expansion efforts he largely dismissed the concerns of some short sellers and analysts that enron might be hiding losses at its core energy trading operations there s nothing wrong with enron s business mr watson said in an interview at the waldorf astoria hotel after making a lunchtime presentation to analysts and investors the people in it ought to be really upset that for the last several years they have produced earnings and cash that have been invested in other businesses that are not making money enron s immediate problem was a crisis of confidence which could have caused other companies to stop trading with it mr watson said a billion cash infusion from dynegy should restore the confidence of enron s business partners and keep enron stable until the takeover is complete he said to bolster enron further j p morgan chase and citigroup may each invest an additional million executives close to the deal said the potential investments by j p morgan chase and citigroup were reported yesterday in the wall street journal mr watson said dynegy would also move quickly to assuage enron employees who are angry that kenneth l lay enron s chairman and other top executives sold hundreds of millions of dollars in stock in and this year as enron s shares plunged right now there s some animosity over there he said many employees at enron will get new grants of stock options when the acquisition is completed he said the company said it expected the deal to close by the end of the third quarter of next year after extensive reviews from federal and state energy regulators and the department of justice mr watson predicted that the deal would lift dynegy s earnings by cents or more a share next year to more than a share analysts backed that view yesterday investments in noncore business distracted the attention of management and also took up capital said thomas hamlin an analyst at wachovia securities mr hamlin said he believed that dynegy had obtained enron which reported more than billion in revenue last year for a bargain price it s not too often you get to take out the no fortune company and double your earnings in the meantime he said my guess is the stock is worth per share the deal could increase dynegy s earnings by to a share next year said christopher ellinghaus an analyst at the williams capital group that s a whopper he said it s a very good deal financially certainly should be a good deal strategically and provides some immediate balance sheet backstop for enron mr lay said in an interview that enron had been forced to sell itself because of the relentlessness of all the articles and the shorts we realized that we needed to do something to stabilize the ship he said a

houston chronicle although investors monday cheered dynegy s planned acquisition of enron corp dynegy must still negotiate a series of potential roadblocks to pull off a successful merger among them ensuring that enron s core energy trading business suffering before the merger announcement stays healthy negative news on that front quickly surfaced monday as at least two traders said they still plan extremely limited business with enron dynegy must also manage any unexpected disclosures about enron s financial performance and investment partnerships convince enron s traders and other key employees to stick around and mesh different corporate cultures investors were optimistic in dynegy s abilities as shares in the company traded up to close at monday while shares in enron ended the day up cents at enron has been under siege since oct when it reported a million loss and billion reduction in shareholder equity tied to business dealings with investment partnerships run by its then chief financial officer since then the securities and exchange commission started an investigation of enron a slew of shareholder lawsuits were filed and enron s stock price plummeted a new shareholder suit filed monday included dynegy on its list of defendants last week enron said it was restating its earnings back to to include losses related to a number of complex partnerships including several being investigated by the sec it said it was correcting almost million worth of mistakes just how close enron was to a collapse remains unclear one industry source believes enron had been pushed to the brink and would have been done for if it had been unable to reach agreement with dynegy last week but ron barone a credit analyst with standard poor s doesn t think enron s condition was so desperate we clearly didn t see this as an imminent bankruptcy or imminent default but it is something that could have eroded over time in a fairly short time friday enron s long term debt rating was downgraded to one notch above investment grade status by both moody s investors service and s p enron is the largest natural gas and electricity trader in the nation accounting for about percent of all transactions its collapse would have meant the loss of much liquidity in the trading market making trades more difficult and prices more volatile industry experts said dynegy announced a deal friday to buy enron at a fire sale price of almost billion in stock plus the assumption of about billion in debt and billion in preferred stock the merger is expected to close barring holdups from regulators in six to nine months as part of the agreement dynegy stakeholder chevrontexaco is giving dynegy billion which is to be infused today to help shore up enron s liquidity and preserve its trading franchise some of enron s former trading partners are still steering clear of the giant to facilitate transactions the various energy trading firms extend credit to one another those agreements are contingent upon a partner maintaining an adequate rating if the credit rating firms had downgraded enron s debt to junk status its trading operation would have been devastated industry officials said as details of enron s questionable financial dealings have been revealed enron s trading partners have been scrambling to reduce their exposure kansas city mo based aquila energy marketing corp for instance has been ratcheting down its activity with enron company spokesman al butkus said by the end of last week aquila s exposure to enron was insignificant butkus said and after all that was revealed on friday and the downgrading of the credit we are now at an even lower level atlanta based mirant has likewise reduced its exposure and is only doing a limited amount of business with enron some larger players however continue doing deals with the company reliant energy has consistently been trading with enron through its difficulties albeit with a heightened sense of caution said shahid malik president of houston based reliant energy s trading operation charlotte n c based duke energy s exposure stands at million we re continuing the way we have been said duke spokesman terry francisco john olson an analyst with sanders morris harris in houston predicted it would take the traders some time to digest the merger deal i think people will increasingly come back to enron just as soon as the billion changes hands he said traders still have incentives to do business with enron even though it s being sold as it has a wider variety of products than some of its competitors and its enrononline internet trading operation is regarded as superior on a conference call with investors and analysts monday morning dynegy and enron executives fielded a variety of questions about the merger but refused comment on a wall street journal report that j p morgan chase co and citigroup are considering a million investment in enron analysts remain worried that new and troubling surprises will emerge about enron s finances including those that could call into question whether its core trading business is as advertised dynegy executives aren t expecting any such disclosures but took a conservative approach to calculating merger benefits i believe we have adequately bracketed the downside said chuck watson dynegy s chairman and chief executive even with a worst case scenario dynegy still found a tremendous amount of economic value in the merger said watson who will take the same roles after the merger the deal dynegy said will add cents to cents per share in earnings for current dynegy shareholders and that s before cost savings that are expected to run million to million a year dynegy detailed two escape clauses in the merger deal for one if the amount of legal and shareholder claims enron must pay out is greater than billion it can be called off enron and dynegy officials also said they will do whatever it takes to keep their key people but will traders jump ship oh yeah i m sure they will the industry source said jeff dietert an analyst with simmons co international in houston believes that a number of enron s marketers and traders will find dynegy a strong alternative i firmly believe that the enron guys like to play on the winning team and dynegy is a very very strong player he said that dynegy was approached by three key enron executives about a merger showed dynegy would be getting the full cooperation of enron s management team watson said enron employees working for dynegy will have to get used to a new culture teamwork and fraternal are words often used to describe dynegy while cutthroat is used for enron which also is known for its willingness to take more risk watson plans to blend strategies and business elements of each the new company will include enron s strong offering of financial products and combine them with dynegy s base of power plants and other assets said steve bergstrom dynegy s president who will take the same job in the new company the post merger dynegy will also be more involved in market making which enron is known for that s the practice of ensuring orderly markets can exist by acting as both the buyer and the seller of a commodity it s unclear whether dynegy will continue enron s foray into other commodities such as paper and metals dynegy hopes enron can complete its planned sale of assets considered outside its core wholesale energy business before the merger closes enron already has deals to sell power utility portland general electric along with about million in international assets billions of dollars in international projects are for sale but watson said dynegy isn t interested in seeing the assets go at bargain basement prices we don t necessarily feel like our back is pinned against the wall in asset dispositions he said bottom of form business financial desk dynegy enron stock prices get boost energy even as experts warn of regulatory hurdles investors back proposed merger nancy rivera brooks times staff writer los angeles times home edition c copyright the times mirror company investors and analysts applauded the proposed billion merger of dynegy inc and enron corp boosting the stock price of both houston based energy companies on monday even as some experts warned of regulatory hurdles dynegy and enron executives courted wall street by offering assurances that the combined company to be called dynegy would be more financially conservative and easier to understand than enron has been dynegy chief executive charles l watson said the merger would immediately sweeten earnings for the combined company and that he remains certain that no more nasty surprises will emerge from a continuing internal investigation of enron s cloudy finances this is an exciting business combination that will fuse two groups of talented dedicated people who share a passion for their work said watson who would be chairman and chief executive of the new company dynegy s stock leaped to close at on the new york stock exchange while enron s stock increased cents to the proposed transaction revealed late friday after days of rumors marks an extraordinary humbling of enron and its powerful chairman and ceo kenneth l lay enron is the world s largest energy trader but a loss of investor confidence and a severe cash crunch have pushed it into the arms of a competitor that is one quarter its size under the deal enron shareholders would get dynegy share for each share of enron stock based on the close friday of dynegy s stock on the new york stock exchange the deal valued enron s stock at a share or a share based on monday s close dynegy would convert million enron shares the company said dynegy said monday that its deal is worth about billion in all the billion stock swap and the assumption of billion of preferred stock and billion in debt enron would get an immediate cash infusion from chevrontexaco corp which owns nearly of dynegy with an additional billion to follow when the deal closes enron s stock fell after a series of disturbing financial disclosures that began oct with a surprise third quarter loss tied to failed investments in water and telecommunications and losses from the termination of some off balance sheet partnerships enron also revealed that billion had been shaved off shareholders equity because of those partnerships the securities and exchange commission launched an investigation into the investment vehicles and the company fired three executives linked to the partnerships an internal investigation led enron to admit it overstated profit by million or going back to all those disclosures are unrelated to enron s core businesses of energy trading energy marketing and natural gas pipelines said dynegy president steve bergstrom and it is those businesses that dynegy wants we have had the opportunity to look under the hood of their core businesses and have found no surprises said bergstrom who would be president of the combined company dynegy expects those businesses alone to add as much as cents a share to the combined company s earnings the first year and dynegy has built protections into the deal if more surprises emerge from noncore businesses or off balance sheet partnerships the executives said among the protections dynegy or enron would receive million if the other backs out of the deal dynegy can abandon the transaction if lawsuit and financial liabilities exceed billion and if the deal falls apart dynegy gets enron s northern natural gas pipeline the combined company would be leader in all of its primary businesses watson said with revenue of more than billion and assets of more than billion the new dynegy would be the world s largest energy trader and would own miles of natural gas pipelines and megawatts of electricity generation it is that powerhouse role that may give regulators pause energy and antitrust experts say california atty

million if you add unexercised option profits to the millions he actually pocketed sad to say lay s paper profit of million at the end of has evaporated as enron s stock lost about percent of its value the houston texas energy company beset by accounting problems is now being bought by a smaller competitor dynegy inc still the year old lay hauled away million a year in real dollars over the last eight years a generous amount given enron s recent admission after the securities and exchange commission opened an investigation that it overstated earnings by million in five of those years lay was enron s ceo from the time it was formed years ago in a merger of natural gas pipeline operators until he stepped down in february for prot g jeffrey skilling skilling left unexpectedly in august for personal reasons ceo s return in six months under skilling enron s total return to shareholders was a negative percent four times worse than the performance of the standard poor s index it was also a sharp contrast to the percent a year enron returned to shareholders over the previous eight years under lay when the company s performance was almost double that of the s p so lay became ceo again after skilling s mid august departure and enron s performance has now been even worse minus percent versus the percent negative return of for the s p while lay has an employment agreement extending all the way to the company s pending acquisition by dynegy leaves his future in doubt for enron s battered shareholders whose stock once was among the s p s top performers that may not be such bad news enron shareholders endured a roller coaster ride during lay s long tenure their stock times as volatile as that of the s p index lay and some other enron executives were responsible for at least some of the heavy activity in their company s shares lay exercised and sold option shares twice a day on every trading day this year through aug on last report in the process he dumped about option shares to reap about million royal treatment that comes atop his realized option gains of million in and another million the year before that shedding large numbers of option shares might seem reasonable for a ceo about to leave the company for someone continuing as board chairman such behavior raises suspicion he might have known before others what a bad investment enron was about to become over the past eight years lay has received bonuses totaling million free shares worth million at the time of their grant payouts under miscellaneous stock option plans of million and a whopping million option shares those figures don t include free personal travel on company planes in alone that little item came to if lay has been handsomely compensated he has treated his outside directors royally enron s current proxy statement informs shareholders that directors in received an average of in cash deferred compensation phantom stock units and stock options granted in lieu of cash who knew by itself that figure might not seem egregious parsing the artful language of the proxy one reads further to find that each outside director also received a stock option covering shares at a strike price of a share i estimate the present value of that option to be making for a director s total pay of an eye popping to be sure those options are now way underwater given enron s closing price yesterday of still the fact they were granted at all suggests that enron s directors must have had a warm fuzzy feeling for lay while treating him so munificently politically too lay has shown generosity and a deft touch he gave directly to president george w bush s campaign another in soft money to the republican party and has long been an adviser to bush on energy matters even if he was unaware of the accounting issues that helped bring down enron lay still profited hugely from a stock price that soared on the strength of inflated numbers and as the ceo he bears ultimate responsibility for what goes on in the company he helped found and has run for most of the past years the question arises to echo a phrase made famous during the watergate era what did ken lay know and when did he know it graef crystal in las vegas companies finance the americas dynegy deal brings balance back to markets by julie earle sheila mcnulty peter spiegel and richard waters financial times c financial times limited all rights reserved dynegy s rescue takeover of enron brought stability back to the companies share prices and the energy markets as trading resumed yesterday morning however executives of the two companies faced a barrage of questions from investors and analysts over concerns that they had not yet got to the bottom of the complex transactions that nearly brought enron down dynegy s shares jumped per cent in early trade while enron s stock rose by more than per cent after the late friday deal that appeared to resolve enron s immediate financial crisis it s a sensational deal for dynegy said john olson of sanders morris harris an investment banking firm in houston it is clearly the best deal of the year when you can buy enron at seven times earnings at approximately book value warts and all you re getting a very good deal dynegy said the merger would lift its earnings per share by per cent next year while the bounce in enron s shares reflected relief that the company s immediate liquidity crisis was over they were still trading at less than a third of their price of mid october charles watson dynegy chairman and chief executive said the deal included provisions that would protect his company s shareholders if large unexpected liabilities emerged at enron he added that he was confident that an investigation into the off balance sheet transactions at enron had left little uncovered dynegy is able to walk away from the deal if enron suffers more than bn in costs from shareholder lawsuits and other liabilities stemming from its disputed transactions executives said however analysts questioned why if enron s core business was so strong the company was being sold at such a discount the deal could also face a tough review in washington given dynegy s involvement as a big trader in many of the same markets where enron is the dominant force antitrust experts said the deal might not get approval unless enron can qualify as a failing firm under the justice department s merger guidelines a failing firm defence used most recently by twa when it was bought out by american airlines in march would require enron to prove there was no other avenue either through bankruptcy reorganisation or acquisition by a third company which would allow it to remain a viable competitor it would also have to show that without the merger it would completely exit the market altogether mr watson also indicated that dynegy would strip enron s operations back to its core energy trading and pipeline businesses raising the prospect of further significant sales and write downs the bn of international assets on enron s books will get marked down dramatically said mr olson they also have to have a moment of truth with the assets in their telecommunications business of about bn in broadband he expects enron to write off about m in hard assets other energy trading firms said that they were moving to reduce their exposure to the company

rewards financial times c financial times limited all rights reserved just as enron is showing us how a public company should not shift private equity exposure off its balance sheet sandy schwab son of charles schwab and middlebury capital a new york based hedge fund are providing an alternative model mr schwab s firm chess ventures is raising a private equity fund that will specialise in financial services technology according to a source close to the fund raising the idea is to attract to banks from around the world to co invest in technology companies specialising in financial services the idea is similar to the corporate venturing activities undertaken by a host of california technology companies they jumped into venture capital in the late s not just because there seemed to be stacks of money to be made but also so they could become partners to thrusting future competitors rather than victims of their cutting edge technology technology is also a vital business for financial services companies and not just for those like schwab with a heavy presence in internet trading every year banks and brokers plough hundreds of millions of dollars into trading settlement and risk management systems but the problems with corporate venturing became clear when companies such as jp morgan chase wells fargo dell and intel registered significant earnings volatility as the value of their venture capital holdings was marked down significantly enron got around these problems by setting up an off balance sheet vehicle with a number of additional investors its idea was to distance its earnings statement from volatile investments in the new power company and rhythm netconnections but eventually those investments came home to roost enron had to compensate it co investors in the structure for their losses arising from its private equity investments and paid a heavy price for the apparent subterfuge of keeping them out of the public view the schwab fund seems to offer the benefits of corporate venturing without some of its costs the investors who it is hoped will eventually contribute m to m to the new fund will share the benefits of whatever technology is developed and they will probably also be the first customers of the companies they are sponsoring but because they are all taking a relatively small part of the pie they should ameliorate their overall risk spreading the risks like this would be hard to pull off in a totally domestic structure corporate venturing is after all meant to give a company an edge over its competitors but diversifying the fund internationally should allow the chess fund to spread the risks the fundraisers are talking to banks in the uk and scandinavia among other places if the theories of growing european cross border integration and competition come to fruition some of the bank co investors might end up competing but in the meantime separating investors by geography seems like a safe bet schwab and the other investors could of course have put their money into other stand alone venture funds that would at least have solved the problem of keeping their volatile private equity exposure on balance sheet but stand alone funds with the sharp focus that a corporate venturing outfit has are fairly few and far between corporate venture capital groups where the corporation involved is a strategic investor rather than just a speculator are usually narrowly focused on their parent group s industry because they are in the business of helping their parent develop a strategic edge a few venture firms focus very narrowly on enterprise software but often they want to keep their options to invest in say biotechnology if that area suddenly looks promising for non strategic investors that approach has clear advantages technology investments have suffered over the last months while biotech investments have held up relatively well if investors are right about the dramatic impact of information technology on biotechnology investors in a general fund that has had the foresight to bet on those changes will probably do very well but the schwab approach is all about venturing as a way to extend research and development venturing can tap into the reserves of entrepreneurship that have served the us so well in the s in a way that traditional research and development probably cannot entrepreneurship does however come at a price young companies can and do fail their values can swing wildly an off balance sheet approach with clear strategic benefits might allow companies to

times c financial times limited all rights reserved comment analysis enron reaps the whirlwind the energy group succeeded brilliantly for a time by creating markets to trade risk but ended up absorbing too much enron s fate is a test case for one of the current era s most powerful beliefs actively traded markets says the new orthodoxy will replace cumbersome monolithic businesses electricity computer chips telecoms bandwidth weather risks petroleum products reinsurance housing finance advertising space the list of goods and services which the new market alchemy would transform is endless even years ago most of these commodities were exclusively handled through vertically integrated business empires some of them did not even exist as identifiable products they were so tightly enmeshed with the business that produced and sold them it all goes back to together the second oil shock and the election of margaret thatcher in britain ushered in the market wave forcing deregulation in the us oil and gas industries and a stream of utility privatisation enron originally just a natural gas pipeline business seized on the new opportunities first in the us gas business then in other areas of energy such as electricity then in a much wider range of goods it started trading these products and services as commodities it was not an old fashioned utility any more but it was also more than a simple trader instead as its former chief executive jeffrey skilling put it enron s operations are built around the integration of modern financial technologies and physical technologies it brought derivatives theory to boring old businesses like gas and electricity and it brought a set of assets that could provide security of supply to the new dematerialised energy trading we will come back to what went wrong at enron later but first notice how much went right in the newly market oriented industries critics argued that an integrated business tightly controlled from the centre was essential for security of supply but british electricity privatisation proved you could switch to a market oriented system quickly and smoothly and the lights stayed on all you needed were proper regulations a freely operating supply side and a bunch of active market makers these were not always present for example the absence of the first two gave california an electricity shortage but if the markets were properly set up everything worked like clockwork the new era had a simple creed before there were effective markets companies needed to be vertically integrated to cope with unexpected fluctuations in demand and supply but now markets allowed them to handle that risk more efficiently buying and selling what they needed trading exploded enron alone recorded revenues of over bn bn in so what did go wrong enron expanded its markets too aggressively moving far beyond energy through a web based platform called enrononline as mr skilling put it in an interview with businessweek we re on the side of angels we re taking on the entrenched monopolies we re bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world expensively enron rushed into trading telecoms bandwidth building a big network to ensure it could deliver a scale of demand that never materialised mr skilling left abruptly in august citing personal reasons this autumn the company announced it had been engaging in transactions with supposedly independent entities that should in fact have been consolidated with its own accounts some of these were headed in a clear conflict of interest by its own chief financial officer correcting the accounting caused big restatements of earnings this may of course just be the growing pains of an innovative but overly ambitious company in that case enron may prosper under new ownership it agreed to be taken over by dynegy a much smaller rival on friday dynegy will slash the range of enron s activities to focus on energy if the sale goes through such an approach may restore enron to health but perhaps the enron problems tell us something more significant about the rush to turn formerly integrated businesses into markets to get these to work requires active market makers like enron creating liquidity in previously illiquid markets soaks up capital nalin kulatilaka professor of finance at boston university s management school has studied enron for years the bottom line is that when the liquidity on the two sides of a market are very different he says a company that tries to lead the way in creating these marketplaces is going to bear sustained liquidity risks the risks that the old system had coped with by building a layer of inefficiency into its operations did not go away in the new market era enron knew all about these risks managing them through complex trades was its essential skill james lam founder of the consultancy erisk says enron has always been recognised by other companies as best practice in risk management it put in systems to manage risk on a real time basis and had very strong management but risk is a bit like a balloon squeeze it down in one area and it bulges out in another even if the operational risk was managed with great skill the underlying riskiness of the strategy enron was pursuing could not be wished away except perhaps by transactions that passed it on to outside entities the problem was that those entities were not really outside at all despite enron s problems the shift to a market based approach is now irreversible for energy markets at least ed krapels who runs energy security analysis in boston says clearly enron s trading culture has been adopted by every one of the big oil companies except exxon but he adds there is a big difference between companies with trading at their core like enron and dynegy and those that have added a trading approach to a business fundamentally based on physical assets such as bp the leverage and aggression in such businesses is much lower dynegy s rescue of enron was only made possible by an injection of cash from chevrontexaco which owns per cent of dynegy s shares call it the revenge of the entrenched monopolies energy markets may not be as efficient without an aggressive enron but if they come back into the embrace of the big physical operators they may cope a little better with the

shareholder equity explaining the equity reduction last week enron said it had given common stock to companies created by enron s former chief financial officer in exchange for notes receivable and then improperly increased shareholder equity on its balance sheet by the value of the notes what we teach in college is that you don t record equity until you get cash for it and a note is not cash

worries that enron s enormous problems could be a drag on the combined entity i don t want the dynegy folks to get into something that s not good for the company she said enron in the past several weeks has seen its stock price and standing in the investment community plummet largely as the result of large scale transactions it did with partnerships headed by enron officers those transactions

james peters a spokesman for energy trader mirant corp traders had scaled back business with enron recently before today its stock had plummeted percent this year the biggest energy trader faced a

service c reuters limited london sept reuters electricity trading in italy is still facing too many difficulties for a liquid market to take off said fabio leoncini president of the italian energy traders association aiget there are a few bilateral contracts traded occasionally but the market is still in a very premature phase he told reuters in an interview on friday one of the main problems he said was that demand for electricity in italy was far higher than supply and production from independent generators very limited because of that it is very hard to guarantee supplies and develop a liquid market said leoncini demand from consumers free to choose their supplier is estimated at terawatt hours twh per year but only a quarter of that comes from independent sources most of the remainder being supplied by former monopoly enel out of these twh twh are covered by electricity imports and the rest is generated by independent producers so the proportion of power available is very small he said in addition construction of new generation capacity was being held up by lengthy administrative authorisation process new entrants currently present in the italian market included u s trading firm enron corp german utility e on spanish endesa u s utility txu as well as newly formed italian trading companies some of the well known traders are doing about five transactions a month and the volume varies a lot so it s difficult to get a clear idea of volume traded said leoncini he added that all transactions were over the counter bilateral contracts for the supply of physical electricity lack of import capacity leading to higher prices electricity imports themselves were difficult to secure because of restricted interconnection capacity at the northern border the main import point into italy the only way to get electricity into italy is to secure cross border capacity so competition is intense leading to high prices said leoncini he added that high capacity prices added to already high baseload electricity prices in italy last year we ve seen capacity prices as high as euros per megawatt hours mwh as a result italian wholesale prices remain very high compared to the rest of europe he said italian baseload electricity prices themselves averaged to euros per megawatt hour mwh compared to prices between and euros mwh in the german wholesale market capacity sale still an issue the system to sell cross border capacity has been a bone of contention in italy with the regulator opting last year for an auction system that was then annulled by the milan administrative court in favour of a pro rata system more recently both italian and french grid operators who manage the interconnections have agreed on a new auction system as aiget we prefer by far an auction system which is more transparent but such a system could still be contested in court said leoncini he added that it was equally important to gain access to other countries grid once cross border capacity was secured it s no longer an issue in france because the management of the grid is separate from the ownership but that s not the case in switzerland and slovenia where access can sometimes be a problem he said switzerland and slovenia which are outside the eu are not subject to the electricity liberalisation directive requiring unbundling of transport and supply activities cross border capacity in northern italy amounts to about megawatts mw but grid operator grtn recently said it had plans to increase it to mw in the next few years power bourse to boost market liquidity leoncini also said that traders were hoping that the new italian power bourse to be launched early next year a year behind schedule would boost liquidity in the market we would have preferred a compulsory pool system but that won t be the case he said adding that the bourse would still bring transparency to the market the exchange will initially launch a physical day ahead

pickering to sales trading cc am subject thoughts on the world of energy osx xng xoi summary at or near inflection points stock calls are all about the big picture this is particularly true of cyclicals like energy although execution is always important for differentiating between companies company specifics mean relatively little to investors right now compared to the big picture we believe the broad market and energy stocks particularly oil and gas stocks currently discount an economic recovery in h and that commodity prices will not crater and will begin to improve with economic conditions valuation for energy stocks is neither particularly cheap nor expensive at this point in the cycle hard to hate them hard to love them moves in either direction would create more interest from us to buy or to sell would call news over the weekend particularly russian as negative especially in light of the light volume rally on friday which has put the stocks ahead of where they should be on a trading basis the big picture crude oil fundamentals and pricing are appropriately the current focus of investors and this has been driving energy stocks on a trading basis we aren t going to be disappointed by the amount of news flow as many issues will be relatively quick to play out within the next several months russia recent news is negative promised reduction in output from k day to k day is a disappointment and makes future opec cuts and compliance more risky volume reductions will be revisited on december th but near term damage has been done conclusion downward pressure iraq nothing is obvious about iraq sanctions renewal is coming up in just a few weeks news is surprisingly quiet on this front with pricing mechanism complaints the only recent commentary from iraqi government intriguing that russia scuttled the us britain calls for smart sanctions last renewal period but now have much more to gain by encouraging events that prompt iraq to leave the export market boost crude prices and help russia win on both volume and price however russian companies are the big winners in rejuvenating iraqi oilfields so do they want to alienate iraq here a blurb over the weekend that iraq caught some iranian plotters against saddam hussein which adds to overall confusion on the iraqi situation conclusion upside pressure war in afghanistan current successes are good for the economy and crude demand but also reduces the near term risk of supply disruptions war premium coming out of crude conclusion downward pressure economy energy fundamentals recent us economic datapoints appear to be modestly better than experts have predicted europe as bad as expected japan remains dismal lower crude and gasoline prices are nice stimulus for disposable income just in time for xmas shopping however even if shoppers are mobbing wal mart worldwide energy demand still appears to be falling on the margin crude inventories rising at a brisk pace vs historical norms for this time of year and more opec and non opec cuts and compliance are needed to maintain a price in the high teens low barrel level conclusion near term downside pressure but glimmers of hope via economy us europe political issues you have to assume that us and european governments care more about reasonably priced or cheap crude oil to stimulate the economy than anything else but also don t want economic chaos in the middle east we continue to gather intelligence from our washington contacts that the us strategic petroleum reserve will be used to support prices but not until wti crude is in the mid teens conclusion modest downward pressure israel palestine more violence over the long weekend still no signs that opec countries taking a significant stance on this issue watch the rhetoric that will come before any action on opec s part conclusion neutral with more likely upside pressure than downside pressure enron situation if ene craters the impact on energy markets is unquantified but certainly significant who knows about what ripple effects could and are occurring conclusion natural gas warm weather and weak industrial demand are a bad combo thank your lucky stars that it was the wednesday before thanksgiving when last week s ugly aga gas inventory numbers were reported falling gas rigcount is the only near term savior and that is occurring gas problems will work themselves out faster than crude and hence our bias toward gassy stocks note that the street has also figured this out as the gassy names have had the best performance off the bottom conclusion stinky and everyone knows it trading influence only investors are really watching crude oil for the next big move in either direction for the stocks stocks overall incorporating

energy refund talks fail in calif federal agency s judge to propose settlement wsj tues california and energy companies miss deadline no deal in energy refund talks by david whitney bee washington bureau published july washington negotiations to settle a tangle of issues arising out of california s electricity debacle sputtered to an end monday with the sides light years apart on refunds for overpriced wholesale power sales the impasse raises the specter of years of litigation with a regulatory judge proposing a formula that could limit refunds to about billion while california is seeking at least billion and perhaps much more federal energy regulatory commission administrative judge curtis wagner said that within a week he ll urge the five ferc commissioners to begin fact finding hearings on how much is truly owed following guidelines he outlined sketchily monday among them would be limiting the time when refunds are allowed something that could reduce state claims by about one third and changing the way power plant costs are calculated to a formula more favored by generators gov gray davis said he was heartened by the judge s belief that california is due some amount of refund money rejecting the generators arguments for no refunds with the day negotiation session nearly moribund generators and power traders had offered up million in proposed refunds in the final days but wagner indicated that that would have to be offset by money the state still owes power companies meaning no cash would actually change hands the judge held out the possibility that at least two parties including san jose based calpine corp could reach separate agreements with the state from what i know it looks like we can reach an agreement calpine spokesman bill highlander confirmed monday but he said he could not disclose any details under wagner s gag order on participants in the negotiations enron corp one of the nation s highest profile power traders said california officials killed the talks by never budging from their claims that the state s consumers deserved at least billion in refunds for overcharges these talks never had a chance said enron spokesman mark palmer their political skins are worth more than million that the taxpayers of california could have used it was about creating and maintaining a tool for a witch hunt of the million compromise offer million was put on the table by what wagner called the big five generators reliant duke mirant williams and dynegy some of whom are under state investigation another million was offered by bc hydro british colombia s government utility which is not under ferc jurisdiction and million was offered by six california municipal utilities the sacramento municipal utility district the state s second largest municipal utility also declined to comment on the talks or any settlement amount it may have offered but said it would outline its position in writing thursday the judge s deadline for comments on his proposal consumer advocates and some industry officials said the judge s brief public remarks make it difficult to predict exactly what the impacts could be on the state s troubled electric scene if the judge is saying that the refund is topped at a billion that s outrageous said nettie hoge head of the utility reform network if they re going to start doing some fact finding hallelujah hoge said the talks had been unrealistic from the start because there was no effort by ferc to determine how high the overcharges had actually been and then work toward a compromise from there the state used a formula calculated by its nonprofit grid operator the independent system operator which was attacked by marketers as wildly high even while the state called it conservatively low joel newton representing all five of the big generators said monday that the iso has consistently based its demand on sketchy and incomplete data the face off between davis and power merchants began last fall as wholesale electricity costs were soaring and california utilities warned that they could be driven into bankruptcy the governor said generators and traders took advantage of the state s power shortage to manipulate markets and gouge consumers generators said they followed all laws and were only deriving fair profits in a scarcity situation ferc which entered the picture because by law it has to ensure that electricity rates are just and reasonable has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to craft a solution that could appease both sides state assembly speaker robert hertzberg d sherman oaks said monday that the failure of the settlement talks to agree on a refund figure comes as no surprise negotiators representing generators refused to even acknowledge the inescapable fact that they have profited enormously by exploiting a dysfunctional market at california s expense he said davis who had accused the generators of failing to negotiate in good faith with state representatives said that although ferc commissioners have been slow to respond to his requests for refunds and for price caps on wholesale electricity they now have the opportunity to redeem themselves he suggested the commissioners can opt to award california more than is recommended by the judge wagner after mediating talks that continued throughout the weekend seemed resigned to the fact that trying to bring more than government utility and power generating entities together proved to be an exercise in futility michael kahn head of the california delegation and consultant to the california iso nonetheless came away thinking the state had fared pretty well we came here wanting billion kahn said in all candor we didn t receive any meaningful settlement offers and so the negotiations were not as helpful as we had hoped they would be but our positions were vindicated because refunds were offered meanwhile pacific gas and electric co and southern california edison sounded the call for more talks we re willing to talk to anyone anytime about a settlement said steve pickett general counsel of southern california edison pg e said in a prepared statement that the sessions provide a solid basis for further negotiations how much money the state might eventually receive remains the big question mark wagner said settlement offers of million suggest that eventual refunds will amount to hundreds of millions of dollars maybe a billion but he also stressed that he would recommend no specific figure to ferc commissioners and does not know how big refunds might eventually be other recommendations wagner said he would make to the commission were a mixed bag for the state the judge said he would recommend refunds no further back than oct an action that kahn said would immediately slice billion off the state s refund analysis that stretched back to may but kahn said that was no defeat for the state which would turn to the courts to recover that and any other sums excluded from a final refund order we still have a viable litigation claim for the remainder kahn said brent bailey vice president and general counsel of duke energy of north america said he felt the formula laid out by wagner would generate a refund order in the range of billion to billion it s a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks bailey said the bee s david whitney can be reached at or dwhitney

writer published july the flood of new electricity being welcomed by gov gray davis was only a trickle at the latest power plant that the governor opened on monday according to sources close to california s energy crisis heralded by davis as part of a powerful one two three punch that will bring california closer to energy independence the los medanos energy center in pittsburg spit out no more than megawatts on its opening day they said that is less than percent of the plant s megawatt operating capacity los medanos could generate a couple of hundred megawatts later this week but is not expected to reach its full output for two to three weeks according to knowledgable sources representatives for calpine and the governor s office when pressed for details acknowledged that the plant was not running at full tilt but said they did not know how much electricity was actually produced monday calpine which will bill someone for whatever electricity it sells from los medanos is keeping track of the production but the figure wasn t immediately available for the media spokeswoman katherine potter said even if it was two megawatts that s two more megawatts that we didn t have yesterday said davis spokesman steve maviglio he said the opening was largely ceremonial timed for the convenience of the governor and calpine s top executive but consumer advocate harvey rosenfield called the media event a deception it was the third highly publicized power plant launch the governor has attended in the past two weeks it s the governor trying to convince people he s hard at work solving the problem when it s all for show rosenfield said he s governing by sound bite he s certainly getting his money s worth from the consultants he hired davis political adviser garry south said last week that the governor s new radio ad campaign will highlight the efforts to produce more power in california generation comes up in our polls as being the no thing people want us to do build more power plants south said then people want the sense that progress is being made that this is not spiraling out of control the other two plants that davis kicked off sunrise in kern county and sutter near yuba city have since been running at maximum capacity calpine anticipates pumping the full megawatts out of los medanos within a week to days company officials said in the first month of these new plants there are always stops and starts said calpine spokesman bill highlander sometimes we shut down altogether including the three just opened facilities new or expanded power plants are expected to add megawatts to the state s struggling electric grid by the end of july and megawatts of that is already in place according to the state independent system operator another megawatts is anticipated for the end of august and more for the end of september under a rough timetable that is likely to see some plants zip ahead of schedule and others fall behind the bee s carrie peyton can

electricity on the spot market revealing a chaotic world in which prices fluctuate wildly within minutes the department of water resources which has been criticized for keeping its power purchasing practices a secret released pages of invoices and trade confirmations that provided the most detailed look yet of its purchases since it jumped into the energy buying business jan the information was released a week after state controller kathleen connell put out details of the state s long term power contracts over the objections of gov gray davis her political nemesis the state has committed about billion to buying power on behalf of california s crippled utilities straining the budget surplus and raising questions from lawmakers and others about davis policies for resolving the state s energy crisis in turn state officials have accused many suppliers of gouging california to the tune of several billion dollars when it came to the spot market the water department was at the mercy of a business run amok the state paid upward of a megawatt hour for days in january and february months when electricity normally should be a lot cheaper water officials said prices have dropped to the range largely because they ve signed a slew of long term contracts reducing their dependence on spot sales our exposure earlier this year to the spot market was at the maximum said oscar hidalgo spokesman for the water department the information released monday covered the first three months of the year and didn t include the highest price the water department has paid for electricity a megawatt hour in may to reliant energy inc a texas generator that owns several plants in the state duke energy corp of north carolina charged even more for power in january a megawatt hour but that sale was made to the independent system operator which runs the state s transmission grid the documents show that while the state s stricken utilities no longer buy power for themselves their sister companies have sold expensive power through may the state paid a trading arm of sempra energy the parent of san diego gas electric some million for power it paid pg e energy trading an unregulated sister company of pacific gas and electric co about million among others the los angeles department of water and power was paid million through may canadian utility bc hydro was paid billion atlanta s mirant corp billion the federal government s bonne ville power administration million and the sacramento municipal utility district million generally the more desperate the state was for power the higher the prices for instance oklahoma based generator williams cos commanded a megawatt hour march when blackouts struck more than million californians location also was critical on march the state paid the pg e trading unit but only to arizona based pinnacle west capital corp the difference was that pg e s power was delivered to energy starved northern california while pinnacle s was sent to southern california where energy wasn t so scarce split second timing was also crucial at a m feb the state paid to mirant for power to be delivered the next day by a m it was paying mieco inc a long beach trading firm for the same product that s the spot market it s the most volatile market in the world and it changes on a second by second basis said enron corp spokesman mark palmer for all the criticism leveled at duke reliant and other big corporations government owned entities were among the most aggressive at charging high prices bc hydro the electric utility owned by the canadian province of british columbia submitted bills for up to a megawatt hour the city of glendale charged a megawatt hour for power in january while smud charged a megawatt hour in march the city of eugene ore averaged a megawatt hour in february we play by the rules of the electricity trade marketplace said bc hydro spokesman wayne cousins our traders worked very hard to find additional sources of electricity to keep the lights on in california had we not come through and stepped forward with these supplies the consequences to california customers would have been severe the state also said it

creative to cut costs by cheryl miller bee correspondent published july to matt muniz the solar panels sprouting on the rooftop of the santa rita jail in dublin aren t just energy makers they re money in the bank when all panels are completely installed this month the kilowatt photovoltaic system the largest rooftop project ever constructed in the united states will cut the jail s demand on the electric grid by up to percent according to muniz alameda county s energy program manager that sun power combined with conservation projects already completed at the jail will slash about a year from the facility s energy bill muniz is already scouting other county rooftops for solar potential with the cost of electricity going up you can start looking at it as a business decision just investing your money said muniz there s virtually no maintenance on this equipment it just sits on your roof and converts right into electricity that you re using as soon as you generate it i think solar is the wave of the future even though it s been around or years the santa rita jail project is among the largest and perhaps most conspicuous examples of steps government agencies are taking to cut electricity use in response to skyrocketing power bills and gov gray davis call for public entities to conserve among the examples san francisco leaders are pondering a bond measure to finance solar powered rooftop projects around the city the tulare county town of lindsay will open city hall two hours earlier at a m and close at p m monday through thursday this summer so offices can stay dark all day friday and during peak use afternoon hours sacramento county has instituted a casual dress policy so employees can better withstand office temperatures that climb as high as degrees workers have also set sprinklers to run at night so that electric water pumps operate during low demand when you start to see the bills going up and you start to hear concerns from some citizens that obviously raises the threshold of wanting to help out said jolena voorhis an energy analyst at the california state association of counties certainly counties stepped up to the plate when they were asked to increase conservation efforts they ve done about as much as humanly possible kings county leaders thought they made a great deal in when they signed up for southern california edison s interruptible load program which promises customers lower rates in exchange for agreeing to shut down electrical services in times of shortage then california s power crisis hit full force this year since january edison has called on the central valley county to cut electricity at its hanford government center times for up to six hours each cycle at times that meant no lights to greet the public no computers to process food stamp requests and during the valley s foggy winter days no heat to warm many of the employees we had one week in january when we were virtually shut down said chief administrative officer larry spikes we just decided we couldn t function that way so kings county supervisors bought a diesel powered generator to match those already at the jail and juvenile center they also decided to open and close administrative offices one hour earlier this summer so buildings can power down before high demand hits the grid around p m the new hours dimmed hallways and moments of darkness that occur when the generators kick on have become a routine part of doing government business these days spikes said so far most counties have been able to absorb higher energy costs without cutting into programs because of relatively healthy budgets in recent years voorhis said public agencies power troubles have proved a boon to some businesses revenues at powerlight the berkeley company that installed the santa rita jail photovoltaic system have tripled since last year the last six months have been particularly intense said janice lin director of business development for powerlight in some ways the energy crisis in california has been a call to action the sacramento municipal utility district which already boasts the largest photovoltaic program in the country has a customer waiting list for solar projects and plans to bring sun power to the state capitol said don osborn smud s solar program manager back in dublin the inmates at the santa rita jail still receive three meals air conditioning and hot showers powered now in part by the plentiful sun in this relatively fog free part of the east bay the million project financed entirely with state and

state threatens suit by mark sherman associated press july washington with talks between the state and power generators stalled california may go to court to help win the billion state officials believe it was overcharged for electricity i think we have demonstrated very clearly both to the ferc and to the judge that the state is owed billion and will settle for nothing less said roger salazar a spokesman for gov gray davis with negotiations at an impasse the administrative law judge for the federal energy regulatory commission said california is probably owed no more than billion in refunds the numbers were too far apart said curtis wagner the ferc chief administrative law judge california wagner said may receive nothing at all because generators may be owed more than they have to return for any overcharges he placed the refunds owed the state at between million and billion power providers had offered million as part of an overall settlement while california state officials sought billion wagner said he said california officials had not made the case for billion in refunds salazar however said the state would go to court and may ask for billion separately wagner split off claims of overcharges from the pacific northwest saying he has not had time to consider those allegations under the short timetable ordered by ferc last month wagner served as a mediator during the days of negotiations and will recommend a settlement to ferc by next monday the commission ordered the talks last month in an effort to resolve differences between producers and the state over the breakdown of california s deregulated electricity market consumer advocates assailed the judge s recommendation and urged the state to continue its attempt to get refunds from what they say are profiteering power companies it s like catching a bank robber but instead of making him give back all of it you only make him give back percent of what he stole said douglas heller spokesman for the santa monica based foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights power generators however were generally pleased with wagner s comments brent bailey general counsel for duke energy said even if the formula wagner recommends produces billion in refunds that s a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks california officials negotiating on behalf of utilities the public utilities commission and state power buyers accused the producers of manipulating supply to unfairly drive up prices the producers have acknowledged prices are high but blame jumps in the price of natural gas which fuels many power plants and the workings of the free market the bill for wholesale power in california soared to billion last year from billion the year before davis has estimated the state could spend as much as billion this year the producers reiterated monday that california s numbers are grossly inflated attorneys for the five major generators duke energy dynegy mirant reliant energy and the williams cos said in a statement that they have made a very substantial global settlement offer reliant would agree to no more than million in refunds as part of an overall settlement that also would have to include protection from additional legal claims said john h stout a company senior vice president but stout also said reliant s fundamental position has been and remains that no refunds are justified refunds in jeopardy as talks fail judge sees possibility of offsets equal to the billions sought by state by toby eckert copley news service july washington settlement talks between california and power providers accused of electricity price gouging collapsed yesterday and the judge who will now hand the case over to federal regulators set a course far from favorable to the state s demand for billion in refunds there are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a billion dollars curtis l wagner jr chief administrative law judge for the federal energy regulatory commission said in previewing the recommendations he will make to the commission but wagner who mediated the talks also suggested that power sellers are still owed sums for electricity that probably are higher than any overcharges for which they may have to pay refunds that opened the possibility that california could see no cash refunds only a reduction in the billions of dollars the power generators and marketers claim they are owed by state entities and utilities wagner said he would recommend that ferc hold a fast track hearing to try to untangle the complex financial claims and counterclaims arising from california s power crisis wagner also outlined a method that he said ferc should use for calculating refunds while his proposed formula includes part of one method the state used it contains several elements for calculating electricity costs that were favored by power sellers who maintain that california s numbers are wildly exaggerated i would suspect that would result in a number much below billion said joe ronan vice president of calpine a san jose based electricity generator i think wagner s method reflects more accurately what actually happened in the state s dysfunctional power market but michael kahn the state s lead negotiator said wagner vindicated california s core arguments the hundreds of people who came here on the other side had argued to the mediator that there should not be any refunds and that position was loudly rejected said kahn chairman of the organization that manages most of california s power grid we think the numbers even using the judge s formula are going to be in the multiple billions whatever amount of money is awarded to us we will have viable claims in state court and other jurisdictions for the remainder so what we have here is a situation where california will get its billion power sellers acknowledged that the threat of litigation remains worrisome to them they sought an end to investigations of their conduct and immunity from legal action as part of their bargaining position during two weeks of negotiations ordered by ferc the two sides came nowhere near bridging their differences wagner said a number of power sellers had put forward offers that totaled million that s a long way from splitting the difference he said in days you can t work miracles yesterday the deadline for completing the talks the ill will between the two sides broke into the open as wagner allowed reporters into the previously closed hearings each side essentially accused the other of bargaining in bad faith and failing to put forward realistic proposals john h stout a senior vice president at reliant energy wholesale group said the state used biased calculations to arrive at its billion refund demand he also said that reliant offered to knock million off the million it claims it is still owed for power sold into the state kahn shot back that reliant made the offer confidentially to wagner and never approached the state figures scrutinized this is the first time we ve heard any of this information and to give the impression that somehow there s been cooperation or forthcomingness i think is misleading kahn said the state s refund calculations were scrutinized repeatedly during the talks the billion figure emerged from a study by the california power grid operator of charges for electricity between may and may a period when wholesale power prices soared kahn said the figure was essentially duplicated when the state went back and calculated what power costs would have been if a pricing method instituted by ferc last month had been in effect for the entire yearlong period ferc ordered the pricing method in a bid to tame wholesale prices in the west in a partial win for the state wagner said he would recommend that ferc use the order retroactively as a basis for calculating refunds an approach resisted by the power sellers but he said that ferc should only scrutinize charges going back to october and should make several key changes in how power generating costs are calculated for instance he said ferc should determine the actual amount of gas heat it takes to generate a megawatt of electricity and use spot market prices in northern and southern california to determine the cost of gas rather than a statewide average cost computed monthly fewer overcharges those and other parts of the complex formula wagner will recommend could increase the benchmark cost of producing power and drive down the amount of overcharges kahn said that applying ferc s pricing method only back to october would put about billion of the state s refund claim off limits brent bailey vice president and general counsel for duke energy north america said we think wagner s modifications are certainly a vast improvement over ferc s june order and also certainly over the state s model america in sacramento gov gray davis issued a statement characterizing the electricity suppliers as pirates who refused to negotiate in good faith while in the past the ferc has shown little if any interest in consumers they now have the opportunity to redeem themselves by returning the billion california has demonstrated it is owed davis said despite the harsh rhetoric both sides indicated that they would continue trying to reach one on one

suppliers charged more than the firms that davis has pilloried records show rich connell and robert j lopez and doug smiths times staff writer july sacramento california s energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by gov gray davis who has aggressively blamed a handful of texas companies state records show during the first three months of this year one of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisis an assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to texas firms according to documents released to the times on monday by the department of water resources which now buys power for california among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatt hour were a canadian public utility a subsidiary of san diego gas electric s parent company and the los angeles department of water and power the report shows their average prices ranged from a megawatt hour charged by powerex the trading arm of british columbia s bc hydro to an hour by the dwp in fact some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by davis and other state officials dynegy inc duke energy and mirant charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period those companies average prices ranged from to per megawatt hour according to an analysis of the documents the figures cover the various types of spot and longer term power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razor thin reserves leading to continuous power emergencies davis spokesman steve maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private out of state generators because in general they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period you have to look at the whole picture maviglio said the governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats he said their profits were to above last year just because there are other entities who are charging us more per megawatt hour doesn t change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from houston tulsa atlanta or charlotte the report by the department of water resources was provided to the times on the same day the state released pages of documents on california s electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year s first quarter the records detail how the state spent nearly billion buying power in the first five months of the year and underscore the complexity of the state s energy problem they also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators oscar hidalgo a spokesman for the water resources agency said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year all the prices were high he said noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in mid january the average price per megawatt hour for all state purchases went from in january to in may spot prices fell from an average of per hour to the reports show in the first quarter of the year some public entities prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies for example houston based enron one of the nation s biggest power traders charged an average of per megawatt hour and atlanta based mirant which sold the most to the state a total of million charged an average of per megawatt hour by contrast a calgary canada firm transalta energy averaged a megawatt hour and the sacramento municipal utility district had average charges of per megawatt hour a spokesman for enron mark palmer said recently that the vilification of enron was based on politics not facts spokesmen for bc hydro could not be reached late monday to comment on its huge sales to the state in the past the utility has defended its pricing practices saying it has offered last minute hydroelectric power that helped keep california s lights on a spokeswoman for sempra the parent company of san diego gas electric said late monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state officials at dwp who could not be reached monday evening have defended their pricing saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high more power bought than projected hidalgo of the department of water resources said his agency s efforts coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices have begun to tame the state s market still the state had to purchase million in power in april and may about more than davis analysts had projected hidlago said that was because of hot weather in may and other supply problems in april he said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in june and early july the reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in june and july partly because spot prices have fallen sharply often to well under a megawatt hour a summary department of water resources report released monday credited davis program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long term power contracts with with moving the california electric energy industry closer to normalcy copyright los angeles times duke energy asked to allow release of data power senator says the generator is refusing to make public some information crucial to the price gouging probe firm says it s complying carl ingram times staff writer july sacramento the chairman of a senate committee probing suspected price gouging during the california energy crisis charged monday that duke energy is refusing to allow him to make public information key to his investigation sen joe dunn d santa ana said duke has made the price bidding information from its chula vista plant available to committee members and staffers but under a federal confidentiality rule the data cannot be made public without duke s consent the documents concern the chula vista plant which former employees have alleged was ramped up and down to drive up power prices during three days in january however state records show that the agency overseeing the electricity grid ordered those gyrations to keep the power flowing throughout the state dunn said duke s refusal thwarts the committee s investigation and efforts to enact possible remedial legislation because the confidential information cannot be shared with others in the legislature or the public dunn said duke cited a rule of the federal energy regulatory commission that gives the company the authority to decide which records it makes public and which stay secret the only one who can release the data is duke we agreed to be bound by what is provided in the ferc tariff nothing more or less he said former employees tell of maneuvers dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to obtain the information elsewhere and release it over duke s objections three former workers at the duke plant near chula vista testified last month under oath that the plant among other things was ramped up and down in what seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the jan emergency but duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the california independent system operator which keeps the state s electricity grid in balance duke later provided cal iso documents backing up its explanation duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to provide a full picture of the plant s operation during the three days but dunn chairman of the select senate committee on alleged price gouging said monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed data duke was guilty of the same tactics duke is trying to draw the impression that it has provided the full picture but they are fully aware that we cannot draw any final conclusions until all that data has been released that hasn t occurred dunn said to make a determination whether the chula vista power was withheld to drive up prices dunn said the committee must publicly examine the bids duke submitted from which the iso issued orders to the plant they include the expensive hour ahead and day ahead markets he said duke a north carolina based wholesaler that operates several plants in california noted that it considers the information proprietary and off limits to legislators not on the committee duke spokesman tom williams insisted that the generator is attempting to comply with the committee s demands but he was unable to say whether duke would agree to make the bidding documents public along with other records the committee plans to turn over we are complying now williams said there is some suggestion that we are leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify i don t know what we are ultimately going to do the committee had threatened to cite eight wholesale generators unless they provide pricing and bidding documents by wednesday six including duke have said they would comply to avoid a contempt citation two enron and mirant were cited dunn said the committee on wednesday likely will give companies that are trying to comply an extra week to do so but others probably will be formally charged with contempt in a report to the full senate the upper house is the final arbiter of such issues although there is scant precedent for levying penalties against those cited for contempt dunn said he favors imposing severe fines in the most recent case a cement company executive was sent to jail copyright los angeles times news analysis concern over price of long term power pacts grows embedded costs may yield more rate hikes critics say and the billion total could complicate plans to rescue edison dan morain times staff writer july sacramento even as the summer progresses without blackouts and gov gray davis prepares for yet another news conference today to symbolically switch on a new power plant the work in the capitol has shifted to the seemingly more daunting task of balancing the books it s a task with potentially far more long lasting implications for state coffers for businesses bottom lines and for consumers wallets in particular long term power contracts trumpeted by the governor s office as helping to bring stability to california s out of control electricity market are having the opposite effect politically a growing concern about the billion price tag of the contracts is complicating one of davis most ambitious energy initiatives a proposed financial rescue of southern california edison which already faces an uncertain fate in the legislature questions about the contracts come as california readies a complex billion bond sale to reimburse the state s general fund for other power purchases critics worry that costs embedded in the contracts on top of the billions needed to pay for the edison rescue could lead to additional electricity rate hikes for consumers key lawmakers consumer advocates and business lobbyists are urging that at least some of the pacts be renegotiated citing a recent plunge in wholesale energy costs these critics say the state should work to shorten the duration of the contracts and lower some of the prices they argue that the state entered into the deals under duress after california s utilities neared insolvency and the state department of water resources took over the purchasing of electricity for more than million residents they are vulnerable senate energy committee chairwoman debra bowen d marina del rey said of deals the state struck with independent power companies when prices were at record highs bowen lauds davis administration negotiators for signing the best deals they could but she said that in the crisis atmosphere in which the negotiations took place the state had two cards and the generators had contracts open to challenges the contracts could be challenged in court or more immediately before the federal energy regulatory commission in washington there an administrative law judge could direct that the pacts be reworked as part of a settlement of allegations by davis that generators overcharged the state for electricity by billion we ought not to say fine the contracts were the best we could do bowen said for his part davis says he is willing to accept partial payment of the billion in the form of contracts with terms more favorable to the state he attributes the recent sharp drop in wholesale electricity prices to conservation the administration s effort to increase power supply and a major factor the long term contracts which slashed the state s reliance on the volatile daily or spot market you can see the value of these long term contracts dramatically shrinking our overall price which is what matters to californians davis said pointing out that the average cost of power plunged from may to june davis energy advisor s david freeman who helped negotiate the contracts said they may end up costing less than billion given the recent decline in prices for natural gas the main fuel for california s electricity generating plants freeman also compared critics to someone who calls the fire department to douse a blaze after the fire is out he said you complain about the water damage the contracts have other defenders among them uc berkeley economics professor severin borenstein who says the deals helped to tame the volatile spot market by reducing generators incentive to drive up prices while reducing the state s exposure to wild swings in price the point of signing long term contracts is not to get a great price it s to reduce risk borenstein said still experts have been picking through the pacts ever since a superior court judge in san diego ruling in a california public records act lawsuit by news organizations and republican lawmakers ordered last month that davis unseal the contracts an analysis done for the assembly by three experts one each representing southern california edison the utility reform network a consumer group and large electricity consumers concluded that the about billion price tag announced by the administration may not account for all the costs when other expenses are factored in ranging from environmental equipment upgrades to any new energy related taxes the contracts could cost an additional to once the contracts were made public senate republican leader jim brulte of rancho cucamonga said just about anyone who can read began calling for those contracts to be renegotiated as buyers remorse spreads through the capitol the contracts increasingly are seen as a hurdle or a bargaining chip as davis and lawmakers confront fast approaching deadlines in their effort to prevent the energy crisis from morphing into a broader financial crisis a bill pushed by davis to avert bankruptcy for the financially hobbled southern california edison must be approved by aug the deadline could be tighter because the legislature is scheduled to adjourn for a monthlong break july davis rescue plan along with legislative alternatives languishes in the legislature the plan which has little apparent support would require the state to buy edison s system of transmission lines for billion and permit the utility to charge ratepayers for the rest of its back debt of billion some lobbyists and lawmakers believe that the electricity rate hike approved in march by the california public utilities commission at cents a kilowatt hour the largest in state history may not be enough the revenue generated under the new rate structure must cover the costs of the long term power contracts and repay the planned billion in bonds which would be the largest municipal deal ever whether there would be sufficient money left to pay for the edison rescue remains to be seen but some experts say the utility may need to seek a separate rate hike to cover its costs as written the contracts have few escape clauses davis cannot simply walk away from them if he concludes that prices are too high still criticism persists and crosses political lines harry snyder longtime sacramento lobbyist for consumers union and jack stewart president of the california manufacturers and technology assn rarely find themselves on the same side of a debate but in separate interviews they sounded similar themes if there is a way to buy our way out of these contracts even if we have to pay damages we d be better off in the long run snyder said stewart like other business leaders does not advocate abrogating the contracts but like many familiar with the terms he hopes that some deals can be renegotiated they are problematic he said in a move that critics fear could lock in high electricity prices for the next decade the davis administration is pushing the puc to agree within a month to limit its authority to question costs incurred by the department of water resources as it goes about procuring power state treasurer phil angelides said the puc must act so he can complete the billion bond sale a binding agreement is necessary so that wall street investors can be assured that they will be repaid the state will be out of cash by the end of the year without the bond sale he said we will move toward fiscal insolvency the so called rate agreement a draft of which was obtained by the times would bind customers of the three big regulated utilities to pay more than just the principal and interest on the billion in bonds consumers would have to pay for consultants lawyers to pay taxes fees and other as yet undefined charges that may be incurred by the department of water resources additionally the puc would be obligated to approve payments for programs by which the state would pay large and small customers to cut electricity use although the legislature has not approved the programs and their details remain to be worked out the department of water resources estimates the cost to be million spread over this year and next it is loaded up senate president pro tem john burton d san francisco said of the proposed rate deal adding that it would require the commission to raise rates to cover whatever the department of water resources decides to do that is giving a blank check to some bureaucratic office he said dictatorial power warning stewart of the manufacturers group also is alarmed by the plan saying it would provide the water agency with dictatorial power as skeptical as we are of the puc process at least there is a process stewart said referring to the commission s procedures to set electricity rates there is no process for dwr dwr just tells the puc this is what we need and the puc must approve it others say the rate agreement is a standard piece of work given the extraordinary step the legislature took in january when it authorized the department of water resources to buy power for utilities that had fallen so deeply into debt that they could no longer carry out their obligation to consumers in essence davis energy advisor freeman said lawmakers in january created the equivalent of a public power purchasing agency beyond the jurisdiction of the puc there is no public power agency in california that is reviewed by the puc said freeman former head of the los angeles department of water and power times staff writer nancy rivera brooks in los angeles contributed to this story copyright los angeles times state s refund demand rejected judge ends rebate talks rebukes billion claim zachary coile christian berthelsen chronicle staff writers tuesday july san francisco chronicle url washington an administrative law judge delivering a powerful message to gov gray davis and california energy officials cast aside the state s claim that it is owed billion in electricity overcharges by generators and called for further hearings to determine hard numbers the judge ending talks designed to settle the dispute between california and power sellers said the state and its cash strapped utilities may owe more in unpaid electricity bills than they are owed for overcharges by the generators the comments by federal energy regulatory commission chief administrative law judge curtis l wagner although a strong endorsement of the generators position seemed to indicate that neither side wanted to settle the issue before it reached the five member regulatory commission there are refunds due to california that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a billion dollars wagner said yesterday at the same time there are sums due to sellers from the california independent system operator and the investor owned utilities in the state of california that probably are higher than any overcharges that the state may come up with now it will be up to the federal regulators to settle the case but the recommendations by wagner who mediated the talks carry significant weight with the commission and cast doubt on the state s chances of collecting the full billion it claims to be owed the judge said he will recommend that the commission order new hearings to calculate what the state and the power sellers are each owed the hearings would be overseen by an administrative law judge and would last to days wagner said closing session wagner made his comments in the closing session of the day talks which were ordered last month by the regulatory commission to try to defuse the dispute between power wholesalers and california officials before it reached the courts the judge s message was a sharp rebuke to the unyielding stand by california leaders especially davis who last week said he wouldn t take a dime less than billion for california s consumers the governor issued a statement shortly after the close of talks insisting that california had won its basic case that the state is owed refunds i am pleased that judge wagner accepted our methodology for calculating refunds and rejected the generators position that no refunds are due davis said the governor s chief representative at the talks michael kahn called the judge s statement a ringing endorsement of the state s call for refunds kahn said the judge s order would improve the state s legal position if it files suit against power sellers generators favored but much of the judge s order seemed to favor the generators for example state officials have made the case they should be refunded billion for alleged overcharges from may to may even though the regulatory commission has said only that the period starting oct could be considered the judge said yesterday that he would stick with the october date meaning that more than a third of the state s claim at least billion would not be refunded by the commission brent bailey vice president and general counsel of duke energy north america said that under wagner s guidelines the state may be eligible for billion to billion certainly to the extent that it helped refute what california has been saying it s a victory bailey said of the judge s statement but davis said the nation s big power sellers never came to the table with a serious offer not surprisingly the energy pirates that bilked ratepayers out of billions of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good faith davis said million offer wagner disclosed yesterday that the generators had made an offer to california million in refunds the judge said the figure included about million from the so called big five generators as well as million from bc hydro s powerex million by a group of electricity marketers million by six california municipal utilities and million offered by other out of state power sellers california officials say it was not a legitimate offer because it included no cash it was simply an agreement by the companies to wipe some of the state s debt off the books throughout the talks generators complained that the california team was trying to shield some california companies and government power providers from having to pay any refunds and trying to disproportionately extract sums from out of state power companies favoritism charged according to documents and interviews the state attempted to remove pacific gas and electric co southern california edison san diego gas electric the los angeles department of water and power and other government power suppliers from the group from which it was asking for refunds even though they were paid the same high rates for power as everyone else representatives for the power sellers said they believe that davis made a political decision to demagogue the companies while refusing to compromise on the state s claims they say the governor calculated that his reputation would be enhanced by continuing to attack the generators the california delegation did not come into these talks with any willingness to compromise said mark stultz vice president of the electric power supply association a washington d c trade group they went in with a dollar figure and never budged on that figure if you re looking for a settlement you have to be willing to compromise up next the federal energy regulatory commission will consider probably on july new hearings on how much if anything california was overcharged if ordered by the commission an administrative law judge will take testimony on how much the state says it was overcharged and how much generators say they are owed regulators will rule based on the judge s recommendation if the parties disagree they can go to court e mail the writers at zcoile

san jose based calpine as a sort of energy favorite son they were the first to enter long term contracts with us the governor said calpine is among the big energy firms being pressed by the state to issue refunds for what the governor insists were overcharges but unlike the others davis said calpine is giving ground in negotiations they likely will be the first to enter into settlements with us he said although the los medanos plant is one of a generation of efficient new gas fired plants that will be as much as percent cheaper to run than their forebears the state will be paying well above current market rates for the first three months of its contract with calpine calpine president peter cartwright insisted however that the company is not making excess profits off the deal to ensure that calpine could provide the electricity even if plant construction wasn t finished by its mid july target date the company bought the needed power from other energy traders at a megawatt hour when market rates were higher he said in addition to the megawatts it has pledged to the state calpine will supply electricity to the sacramento municipal utility district and other power agencies in the long term calpine will be selling power to california at a megawatt hour cartwright said a spokesman for the state department of water resources which started buying power in january after state utilities buckled under high prices said calpine s rate is well below the a megawatt hour the state is aiming for as an average price for the long term contracts cartwright said that with its recently

resources detailing billion in power purchases from jan through the end of may about billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys are made a day hour or even a few minutes before the electricity is actually used because the spot purchases are made with little notice they are the most expensive kind of power on the market the state was forced to step in and buy the power when the

the facilities include chemical plants oil refineries and small shops that produce limited amounts of hazardous materials for many of these businesses the loss of power would shut down their operations and make it impossible for substances to be released larger facilities like oil refineries have either their own backup generators or contracts with cogeneration plants that could supply

p m pdt monday july by jim puzzanghera mercury news washington bureau washington california officials and power suppliers failed to agree on refunds for electricity overcharges as days of contentious negotiations ended monday leaving the matter in the hands of a federal judge who said the state is owed much less than the billion it demands the judge overseeing the talks for the federal energy regulatory commission put the refunds at between several hundred million dollars and a billion dollars his estimate is closer to the million offer made by power suppliers during negotiations the offer was rejected by california officials but it was unclear monday which side in the bitter refund battle would prevail and california officials indicated the dispute is probably headed to court at stake is how much the state s electricity consumers will ultimately have to pay for costs that skyrocketed as california s deregulation system collapsed curtis wagner the commission s chief administrative law judge will recommend a formula for the commission to use to calculate a refund dating back to october that formula a complex methodology that involves factors such as daily natural gas prices includes many of the provisions the energy suppliers had advocated during the talks michael kahn who headed the california negotiating team said the state would contest some aspects of the formula but even without changes kahn said he was confident the formula will result in more refunds than wagner estimated we think the numbers even using the judge s formula are going to be in the multiple billions said kahn chairman of the state independent system operator which runs the electricity grid california will get its billion dollars if we don t get all of it from the commission we ll still get the remainder of the money through the courts amount in dispute power industry representatives appeared pleased with the judge s plan we haven t gone and run the full numbers but it s going to be nowhere near the billion said brent bailey vice president and general counsel for duke energy north america but let s face it that s a pie in the sky number that nobody in there believed in their right mind was a legitimate number wagner acknowledged he had not calculated any figures using his formula saying he arrived at his dollar estimate based on the offers made by the suppliers the energy commission ordered the private settlement conference last month when it enacted new price controls to try to rein in soaring electricity prices in california and throughout the west commissioners hoped that under pressure of a deadline and their looming intervention the state and the power suppliers could resolve the refund issue and stave off future litigation but the suppliers and state officials never came close to a deal participants said the numbers were too far apart you saw billion on one end and you saw million on the other end and that s a long way to splitting the difference wagner said i think a lot of the parties genuinely wanted to settle others didn t wagner now has until monday to make his recommendation to the five member commission which will make the final ruling on refunds to date the commission has ordered million in refunds for periods since last oct wagner said monday that he will ask that a special hearing be set up in the next days to get the detailed information from the state and power suppliers needed to determine a refund total using his formula the state may not end up with any cash as any refund total could be applied to the several billion dollars california and its utilities still owe many of the power suppliers reflecting the tone of the negotiations california gov gray davis on monday blamed power suppliers for the failure of the talks and challenged the commission to resolve the situation not surprisingly the energy pirates that bilked ratepayers out of billions of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good faith with our team in washington d c davis said while in the past the ferc has shown little if any interest in consumers they now have the opportunity to redeem themselves by returning the billion california has demonstrated it is owed davis may go to court at the opening of a new power plant in contra costa county on monday davis told reporters that he s prepared to take the power generators to court if ferc doesn t order the full refund davis also said the iso s estimate of billion doesn t represent all the overcharges he said other estimates put the figure as high as billion although he did not elaborate about how those figures were calculated john h stout senior vice president for reliant energy wholesale group said the state used faulty methodology to arrive at the billion figure california officials and several suppliers said they would continue to negotiate separately and an official with san jose based calpine said his company is close to a settlement with the state power suppliers urged wagner not to calculate refunds by applying the energy commissions june price limits plan retroactively but that s what wagner said he will do it was a victory for california officials who had pushed for it wagner however also made some changes to the price limit plan that power suppliers had wanted he applied it only back to oct state officials wanted it to cover up to may billion difference the state s billion figure comes from may through may factoring refunds beginning with oct eliminates about billion in overcharges the state says occurred in the earlier period among the changes to the commission s formula that wagner made was to revise the way the prevailing electricity price limit is calculated wagner wants the price limit determined for each hour of each day the commission s formula sets a price limit during stage one power emergencies that remains in effect until the next emergency but in a sign of just how complex the issue is stanford university economist frank wolak said he believes the standards described by the judge will produce a much higher figure than billion that s the methodology the state used said wolak who advises the california iso on market issues by using the marginal unit for each hour you ll get refund numbers on the order of what the state estimated mercury news staff writers brandon bailey and dana hull contributed to this report contact jim puzzanghera at jpuzzanghera krwashington com or power purchase bills exceed billion published tuesday july in the san jose mercury news by mark gladstone noam levey and dion nissenbaum mercury news sacramento bureau sacramento six months after jumping into the electricity business the davis administration on monday provided the first detailed glimpse of california s daily power purchases showing more than billion in payments much of it to government owned utilities and private companies that state officials have branded as price gougers the state spent an additional billion on a variety of contracts and other electricity services designed to stabilize the volatile energy markets according to documents that the state agreed to release last week amid a legal dispute over public access to the data in roughly the first five months of the year the state shelled out billion to atlanta based mirant the most any company was paid for electricity followed by billion to powerex the marketing arm of bc hydro in british columbia it also paid million to the los angeles department of water and power the documents raise questions about some of the common assumptions that have arisen around the electricity crisis for instance almost percent of the state s purchases have come from government run power generators in california and elsewhere but not texas some of the biggest suppliers are from the northwest gov gray davis who has ambitions to run for the white house has put much of the blame for the soaring costs of power on energy companies based in president bush s home state the figures are tucked inside of pages of invoices that davis has resisted divulging saying disclosure would encourage suppliers to charge more the state which last month released information on its long term electricity contracts worth billion agreed thursday to release the first quarter details short on explanation the figures were disclosed late monday by the california department of water resources which buys power for the state s financially strapped major utilities and seem to buttress the administration s contention that the price of power is gradually dropping but offer little or no explanation for what prompted the decrease in january for instance the average price for power on the spot market was a megawatt hour it peaked in april at and dropped to in may one megawatt powers about homes davis spokesman steve maviglio said the price data supports the governor s assertions that california has been gouged the bad guys are clearly the out of state generators maviglio said there has been a significant shift of money out of california but the documents fail to shed much light on whether as the administration contends the price drop was due to long term power contracts negotiated by the state earlier this year critics contend that the davis administration panicked and rushed into deals that commit the state to pay high prices for many years used for support republican officials used the price information to bolster their attacks against davis a democrat for signing long term contracts with power generators even as the price of power on the spot market was coming down partly because of the declining price of natural gas used to fuel many plants it s more clear than ever that the long term contracts are a bad deal said assemblyman tony strickland r camarillo the governor s really hurt the ratepayers for the next five or years the newly released bills highlight the volatility of california s energy market where the price per megawatt hour ranged from to on any given day the records show the prices from seller to seller varied widely with some of the highest prices being charged by public utilities and companies outside texas on one day in february for example san diego based sempra energy was charging per megawatt hour the eugene water and electric board was charging nearly and duke energy a north carolina company was charging up to the state s daily spending peaked may at million for all power including the spot market and contracted power the state began buying power in mid january on behalf of the state s major utilities which were unable to borrow money to buy power after amassing enormous debts for electricity san jose based calpine corp which is building several new power plants around california including one in south san jose did only million worth of business with the state in the first five months of the year according to the figures the state began buying power in mid january when pacific gas electric co and southern california edison co were on the ropes financially pg e later went into bankruptcy on monday state lawmakers took another shot at trying to cobble together a plan to rescue financially ailing edison while most concede that a rescue plan davis worked out with edison will not win the necessary support in the legislature lawmakers have created several working groups to come up with alternatives compromise plan on monday state sen byron sher d redwood city unveiled the latest compromise proposal that seeks to protect average ratepayers and small businesses from further rate increases and forces everyone else to help finance the edison bailout the shared pain proposal would force power producers owed about billion to take a percent haircut and agree to forgive about million in edison debts edison would be asked to swallow billion about a third of its debt and big users would be asked to pay off the remaining billion in debts possibly by paying higher prices for power in exchange large companies would be given the opportunity to buy power on the open market a system that would allow many of them to sign cheap energy deals sher presented the proposal to senate democrats monday afternoon but it remains unclear how much support the framework will receive in the legislature contact mark gladstone at mgladstone sjmercury com or refund outlook dims talks break down judge says state is owed much less than its billion demand and unpaid bills may offset gains july by dena bunis and john howard the orange county register washington the nation s chief energy judge said monday that california is owed maybe billion in refunds from power generators a fraction of the billion demanded by gov gray davis and even at that said judge curtis wagner the electricity sellers are owed so much more in unpaid power bills that in the end california might not see one red cent wagner announced his recommendation to the federal energy regulatory commission after two weeks of fruitless negotiations between all the parties to california s electricity crisis with no settlement the matter is now in the commissioners hands power generators wagner said had offered a combined million in refunds an offer the state rejected i don t think it s billion dollars he said afterwards because i haven t been shown that it was for california consumers every dollar the state can extract in refunds is a dollar less that ratepayers have to shell out for state purchased power and the more money the state gets back the better the chances of warding off future rate increases california will get its billion insisted michael kahn head of the state s delegation and the california independent system operator kahn brushed off wagner s comments finding victory in the judge s assertion that the state is owed some refunds a concept the generators have been unwilling to embrace up to now he said since the talks began some generators have made refund offers last week duke energy offered million and on monday reliant officials revealed their refund offer was million provided all other actions against the company were dropped but the net result of the day closed door sessions is that california is no closer to getting repaid for what it claims was price gouging by power companies going back to may than it was the day the talks began and it means the state is in for possibly more hearings before the ferc if unsuccessful there the whole issue could wind up in court for years you can take a horse to water but cannot make him drink wagner said during an afternoon public session where he made his preliminary recommendation he has seven days to put his ideas in writing at several points during the often tense talks wagner expressed frustration to the negotiators and tried to get them to agree even to the point of holding an unprecedented sunday session the numbers were too far apart wagner said while kahn insisted the state had made progress on hearing of the judge s comments state sen john burton d francisco called them barely better than a jab in the eye with a sharp stick burton agreed with kahn that the state has to do all it can to get more than that and davis backed up his team our delegation made a clear and compelling factual argument that there were overcharges made because the market was broken davis said remarkably the energy generators and suppliers refused to recognize their responsibility to the people of california and own up to their profiteering power generators seemed satisfied with the judge s views even though john stout vice president of reliant energy said his company s fundamental position has been and remains that no refunds are justified brent bailey general counsel for duke energy called the judge s recommendation a fair one republican lawmakers in sacramento were quick to say it was davis failed energy policies that brought california to this point they also distanced themselves from the state s refund request i don t believe there really exists a true justification for that number said assemblyman john campbell r irvine i ve never considered that anything more than a wild number to throw out there the two sides are so far apart in their estimates of overcharges because they are using different assumptions about how to compute the complex pricing structure and wagner was more persuaded with the majority of the generators methods to start with the state is asking for billion but about billion of those alleged overcharges happened between may and october a period ferc is not looking at ferc issued two refund orders in march finding that power companies had million in overcharges during power alerts but the state is challenging that finding saying there were overcharges beyond those limited times and the state is also asking ferc to reconsider allowing refunds for may to october how energy panel affects california six months ago few people had heard of ferc now the federal energy regulatory commission the agency charged with making sure that the nation s power markets are running smoothly and that wholesale prices are just and reasonable rolls off the tongue the five commissioners who make up ferc all of whom were members of their home state s public utilities commissions ordered the settlement talks that concluded monday they had hoped all the parties involved in california s electricity crisis could reach an agreement on proposed refunds long term power contracts and other issues that have divided the parties for months ferc s chief judge curtis wagner was asked to mediate the talks what was at stake for the state billion that gov gray davis said was the amount power companies overcharged california in the past year wagner s finding there should be refunds but more like billion for the generators more than billion that they say they are owed for unpaid power bills wagner s finding generators are owed more money than the refunds they owe california he did not specify by how much for california consumers a stable electricity market until the refund issue is settled and power prices are stabilized long term what the future holds for rate increase remains uncertain wagner s finding no settlement consumers still in limbo how did we get here in spring wholesale power prices began to soar the state began appealing to ferc to cap wholesale prices in the meantime the utilities were running out of money generators weren t paid for all the electricity they sold rolling blackouts began starting in january the state began buying the power replacing the near bankrupt utilities politicians from sacramento to washington increased the pressure on ferc to cap rates more than billion was spent to buy power for california last year compared with billion the year before the price tag could reach billion this year on june ferc imposed the kind of soft price caps experts say could moderate wholesale rates wholesale prices have come down but the caps have caused confusion among generators leading some to hold some power off the market what s next the ferc commissioners will receive wagner s report within a week in it he will suggest they hold a fast track formal hearing that would last no more than days if they agree after that hearing the commission would rule on refunds and other california market issues if either the state or the other parties to this dispute disagree they can contest ferc s decision in court such legal proceedings could last many years state reveals details of power purchases report shows last minute energy buys in first three months of july by jennifer coleman the associated press sacramento on three days in may california s daily power allowance topped million according to a report released by state power traders the california department of water resources released the report monday along with pages of documents that also detailed the last minute power purchases the state made on the spot market in the first three months of the year the report details the department s electricity spending since jan when the state took over electricity purchases for pacific gas electric co san diego gas electric co and southern california edison the utilities had amassed billions in debts and were no longer creditworthy enough to purchase power since then the state has spent nearly billion to keep the lights on the state s daily spending peaked may at million the second highest daily total was may when the state spent million but since may spot market prices have dropped due in part to moderate weather lower natural gas prices increased conservation that lowered demand and because of increased scrutiny by lawmakers and investigators into possible price manipulation gov gray davis has said long term contracts also drove the price down it does look like some of the spot market prices have gone down but it looks like it s primarily due to natural gas prices said jamie fisfis spokesman for assembly republicans the slight reduction in spot market prices underscores questions about the strategy of locking us into long term contracts if natural gas prices continue to drop fisfis said most of the long term contracts run for years with one lasting for years davis already has released details of the state s long term power contracts after losing a court battle with republican legislators and several news organizations but davis wanted to delay the release of the spot market buys and short term contracts until now to keep the state s buying strategy secret according to the state atlanta based mirant corp got billion as of may for spot market purchases canadian powerex the marketing arm of bc hydro has been paid billion the newly released short term contracts also show that on march when the state had rolling blackouts the state paid above average prices in its largest short term contracts for example mirant sold the state megawatt hours at off peak usage times on march for a megawatt hour more than above the average price of tuesday july ghost of bob citron roaming halls of capitol gray davis is following footsteps of former o c treasurer into fiscal chaos john m w moorlach mr moorlach is the orange county treasurer tax collector a recent l a times poll found that californians still remain unconvinced that our state suffers from a shortage of energy perhaps the state s subsidizing of the actual costs for electricity these past five months has caused us to believe that everything is fine it is not the state has been spending an average of million a medium sized city s annual budget per day for electricity now california is headed toward the same financial catastrophe that was imposed on its shareholder owned utilities finding one of them in chapter bankruptcy and another on the precipice at this pace it will not be long before the state will be staring a chapter bankruptcy filing in the face that s why i m gnawed by this d j vu sensation the similarities and parallels between california of and orange county of are frightening here s a refresher in the county through former treasurer robert citron was borrowing at variable rates and investing at fixed rates the experts and the politicos were comfortable with the investment scheme no wonder the electorate was convinced that there were no investing improprieties even while their former treasurer was very secretive about how he was investing and what his exit strategy would be guess what the unexpected happened short term borrowing rates doubled the cost of borrowing suddenly exceeded the revenues being generated it caused the investment pool to implode and orange county taxpayers realized a billion loss in spite of pleas to avoid or minimize this train wreck the county s leadership he ignored it the rest is history in a half pregnant deregulation scheme the state capped the retail price that the utilities can charge it also eliminated the availability to acquire electricity through the use of long term contracts guess what the unexpected happened the wholesale price for electricity spiked dramatically above the inflexible retail price cap it depleted the available funds for the utilities and then some and they are imploding in spite of pleas from the utilities imploring gov gray davis to avoid or minimize this train wreck he ignored them the rest is also history it gets worse davis doesn t allow for the immediate raising of retail rates and decides to have the state secretly purchase electricity guess what the expected happened he depleted our budget surplus our reserves nearly billion and counting he s a citron only quintupled and in the light of day the secret purchases were not attractively priced and only compound this financial nightmare gov davis has done what no libertarian or republican could ever dream of doing in such a short time he has returned the budget surplus created by taxpayers to the residents of california by subsidizing their electricity bills bravo it may not be the most equitable way of refunding taxes but has anyone ever thought up a more efficient method but that s not all he wants it back davis now wants to borrow some billion to replace the spent reserves and purchase even more electricity at rates in excess of the retail prices when does this train wreck in slow motion stop and how do we pay off these bonds davis did not want to raise rates last summer or this past winter but now he will to pay off this historically largest municipal bond offering with a significant utility rate increase the ratepayers will be reminded for years after davis is gone about his expensive brilliance and this elected official wants to purchase the power grids and bureaucratically manage the utilities i say no if we don t show some leadership in sacramento soon potential bond buyers will also say no unless they receive an attractive interest rate just ask edison international about attractive interest rates it just subscribed million in bonds paying percent tragically gov davis walked into his position with an existing budget surplus and now has no tangible legacy to show for it no reserves no improved highways no new schools no infrastructure improvements only interest payments wasn t that citron s legacy if amortized over years at percent the citizens of california will pay an additional billion in interest costs over years it s billion and therein lies the true legacy of davis squandering the entire budget surplus that he inherited on interest resulting from his indecisiveness and lack of leadership it is so tragic that the perpetrator of this colossal mess is still in denial and continues to play the blame game orange county played the blame game too but it had obvious perpetrators and succeeded in a court of law in securing a significant amount in retribution payments i m not so sure california will have a similar result

still split after week talks by joseph kahn the new york times page column c new york times company washington july a federal mediator ended two weeks of negotiations about california s demands for electricity refunds today with the state and power suppliers seemingly no closer to a settlement than when the talks began the failure of the negotiations shifts the burden of resolving the yearlong dispute to the federal energy regulatory commission to which the mediator may recommend a pricing formula that would mean refunds of about billion california which wants billion vowed today that it would seek that much and more through the courts if necessary although electricity prices in the west have eased in recent weeks the power crisis that has afflicted california and other western states seems unlikely to be resolved unless rival parties can agree on how much electricity should have cost during the last months the power market has been mired in an accounting gridlock the state claims that generating companies began grossly overcharging for electricity with prices soaring by a factor of or over year before levels beginning in late spring last year generators say they are prepared to pay some refunds but argue that california s estimates of overcharges are radically inflated the mediator in the settlement talks was curtis l wagner jr an administrative law judge for the federal agency who said today that the negotiations had failed to reach the comprehensive voluntary settlement he had sought mr wagner said he would recommend to the agency s commissioners that they convene a day evidentiary hearing that would impose an administrative solution he also said he would suggest a method for determining fair prices for electricity under federal law the energy commission has the obligation to ensure just and reasonable electricity rates though the commission declared last year that california s electricity market had broken down it only recently began imposing price controls on the market and has yet to address accusations of past overcharges systematically while the scope of any refunds remains uncertain mr wagner s remarks appeared more favorable for generators than for western states which have collectively pressed for as much as billion in refunds mr wagner said that to determine how much california should have paid for power since last september when the commission began monitoring california energy prices he would suggest that the agency retroactively apply a price control formula it adopted in june he also indicated that he supported a way of calculating the costs of power generation that is closer to the method favored by power companies than to the one put forward by california officials the judge suggested that the formula he is recommending could require generators to pay back hundreds of millions or maybe a billion dollars california officials gave a positive cast to the judge s statements calling them a step forward because he formally acknowledged that companies would have to pay some refunds they also noted that whatever the level of federally mandated refunds they would have the option of seeking more in court we are still going to get the billion said michael kahn who represented gov gray davis of california in the talks if we don t get it all from the commission we will get the remainder in the courts governor davis himself said today that if the agency did not provide refunds in the amount the state claims it is owed it would sue generators for billion to billion we are in a war with generators mostly out of state that are trying to bleed us dry mr davis said speaking at the ceremonial opening of a power plant in northern california representatives of several generating companies said that during the settlement talks they collectively offered to refund california about million they estimated that the calculation method suggested by the judge would result in refunds of no more than billion far closer to their offer than to california s demand still several executives said they now hoped to reach individual settlements with the state that would end the threat of prolonged litigation and allow them to collect several billion dollars they say they are owed by the state and its leading financially pressed utilities which ran up huge debts to suppliers in the last year we remain very interested in reaching a global settlement with the state that will put this problem behind us once and for all said brent bailey vice president and general counsel of duke energy financial energy refund talks fail in calif federal agency s judge to propose settlement peter behr the washington post final page e copyright the washington post co all rights reserved california consumers were overcharged by as much as billion by electricity suppliers since october a federal administrative judge said yesterday after state officials and power suppliers failed to reach an agreement on the disputed charges gov gray davis d and california power officials wanted billion in refunds dating back to may when the state s energy crisis began a group of generating companies headed by units of duke energy corp reliant energy inc and williams cos offered refunds of million in the past week going back to october the companies said refunds should be offset by the larger amounts they are owed for unpaid power deliveries to the state the numbers were too far apart curtis l wagner jr chief judge of the federal energy regulatory commission told reporters after two weeks of closed negotiations ended yesterday wagner acknowledged that his refund number was imprecise and said further hearings before ferc are needed to pin down the figure calpine corp of san jose and possibly one other supplier are expected to reach individual settlements with the state the judge said a lot of the parties genuinely wanted to settle and others didn t wagner told reporters there s an old southern saying said the year old tennessean you can take a horse to water but you can t make it drink he declined to say which side balked but previously he had blasted california officials for not modifying their initial demands wagner said he will send his own refund formula to ferc s five commissioners within a week his formula essentially will reflect what he thinks reasonable electricity prices would have been in the state at various times since october considering fuel costs and other factors charges over those levels would be subject to refund if ferc agrees the judge s recommendation is likely to carry considerable weight with ferc s commissioners according to energy analysts earlier this year ferc tentatively ordered million in refunds for the first three months of this year an amount that davis called far too low facing increasing political pressure from congress ferc with two new members appointed by president bush has taken a harder line on california s power prices last month the commissioners imposed price restraints on wholesale power transactions in california and other western states wagner patterned his formula after ferc s ruling last month the nation s wealthiest state has been battered by an extraordinary surge in electricity and gas prices that have pushed its electricity costs up from billion in to an estimated billion last year power prices did not retreat from record levels until last month davis s top aides quickly claimed vindication yesterday we think the numbers even using the judge s formula are going to be in the multiple billions said michael kahn chairman of the california independent system operator the state s power grid manager kahn noted that the state refused to drop a growing list of legal claims against the principal energy suppliers most of them headquartered outside the state the companies had insisted on being released from the state s legal claims as part of any settlement according to sources close to the negotiations we will have a viable claim in state court and other jurisdictions for the remainder kahn said california will get its billion but the state s own expert witness economist eric hildebrandt chief market monitor for the california grid testified before wagner that the out of state generators and other nonpublic power suppliers would owe about billion using ferc s pricing formula of last month less than half the billion goal duke energy is very pleased by wagner s action said brent bailey vice president and general counsel of the charlotte based company the generators however repeated their claims that davis is trying to make them scapegoats for the state s failed electricity deregulation plan the major generators in a statement yesterday said they had delivered only million megawatt hours out of the million the state power grid used from october to last may a megawatt supplies enough power for about homes california utilities and municipal power companies also reaped large profits the generators said the refunds sought by california would send a profoundly counterproductive message to suppliers when prices are low and surpluses exist you face a steep downside when scarcity develops and prices rise we will take away all upside profit no one will invest in california power facilities in that climate the generators statement said the power supply shortage thus will continue without relief contact economy california and energy companies miss deadline by richard b schmitt the wall street journal page a copyright c dow jones company inc washington state officials and power company executives failed to meet a federal deadline for settling billion of disputed california electricity charges as a federal mediator overseeing the talks suggested the state s demand was excessive cautioning that he hadn t done formal calculations curtis l wagner jr the chief administrative law judge of the federal energy regulatory commission put the level of potential refunds at hundreds of millions of dollars maybe a billion dollars he also said any sums due the state could well be offset by monies its insolvent utilities owe in unpaid power bills mr wagner said he would recommend to the commission that any refunds be calculated only from october the state had been seeking rebates calculated from may in line with an earlier ferc jurisdictional ruling that decision alone would shave billion from the billion claim mr wagner who is expected to issue formal findings in the next few days said he would recommend that the ferc hold an evidentiary hearing to assess the correct method for figuring refunds the collapse of the talks doesn t preclude individual deals later between energy companies and the state which has accused them of overcharging for power during the past two years yesterday some industry lawyers indicated a willingness to keep bargaining and mr wagner said two partial settlements were in the works yet absent any such solution the overcharge issue a flash point in the california power crisis is apt to be resolved in protracted legal and regulatory proceedings which could drag on for months or even years the negotiations began june with a deadline set for midnight last night but late yesterday participants indicated they were billions of dollars apart with basic differences over everything from the disputed charges to doubts about whether the ferc which ordered the talks could enforce a deal because of the industry s questions about the reach of the agency s authority we haven t reached a settlement we really haven t come close said john stout a senior vice president of reliant energy inc s wholesale power group reliant had offered to pay california about million to extricate itself from the fight that is more than a third of the houston company s operating profit during the relevant period he said although far shy of the more than million california sought from reliant mr wagner said the industry offered a total of million to settle the matter the refund issue is fast becoming a test of the agency s authority and credibility the ferc a onetime regulatory backwater has come under intense scrutiny of late for its largely hands off monitoring of deregulated california markets the commission has ordered some companies to pay refunds but they have been relatively small such as a million rebate covering wholesale electricity bills in california in january and february california gov gray davis has said he hopes two new ferc members will take a much more aggressive tack the agency is expected to act quickly on the judge s call for a hearing and other findings yesterday michael kahn a san francisco lawyer representing gov davis at the settlement declared he was gratified by mr wagner s findings saying they validated the state s claims to some refunds a concept the industry had rejected at the talks outset we ve had a ringing endorsement of the idea of refunds and we ll get back lots of money he said adding that what the state doesn t recoup via the ferc it will pursue in court but power generators who derided the state s request for a huge refund as ludicrous and unsound felt vindicated by yesterday s proceedings the state came away with far less than its expectations said robert loeffler an attorney for a unit of aes corp of arlington va the common expectation now is that any refunds will be way below this billion,Phishing,Data Breach,0.5713147752838177,False

report s negativity judicially controlled auctions for the selection of counsel in class actions should be used only in certain limited circumstances according to a draft report issued by the third circuit task force on selection of class counsel an auction might be appropriate for a case in which the defendant s liability appears clear damages appear to be both very large and collectible and the lead plaintiff is not a sophisticated litigant that has already retained counsel of its choice through a reasonable arm s length process the task force suggests several judges criticize the report as being too hostile toward the innovative idea of competitive bidding for selecting class counsel the judges participating in a panel discussion at the third circuit judicial conference say the report is too restrictive for instance the task force should encourage more experimentation with the process of setting fees at the outset of litigation rather than waiting until the end one judge suggests but others who agree with the tenor of the report say bidding is overrated as a means of keeping counsel fees reasonable page s page new york bar proposes amending aba model rules to allow
