"The Labour Party says a second person has come forward alerting it to what it calls significant holes in the Ministry of Justice's website. The ministry shut down parts of the website on Tuesday after Labour MP Clare Curran said she was approached by a whistleblower who had accessed ministry passwords and databases through a search engine on the site. Ms Curran, the party's information technology spokesperson, said the information provided included a password to an online payment system and she informed the Justice Ministry and its minister, Judith Collins. Ms Curran said a second person has been allowed easy access to more than 60,000 documents in the Tenancy Tribunal section of the website. She says Ms Collins is attempting to downplay the matter - but it is a serious security issue. ""This information is explosive in the sense that it clearly demonstrates the systemic issues that are occurring across government agencies all showing serious breaches of people's information."" However, Judith Collins says no personal information was accessed. ""This is essentially like a burglar getting past the front gate of your house of your property, but actually not getting past the front door. No personal information has been accessed. ""The passwords that they refer to are passwords that can only be used from within the Ministry of Justice's system."" However, Clare Curran says both breaches are basic security flaws that do not require a lot of computer programming knowledge. A Justice Ministry spokesperson says documents referred to by Ms Curran are all publicly available. All relate to tenancy tribunal decisions and are available on the Tenancy Tribunal website, he says.",Data Breach,Insider Misuse,0.399892538117918,False

"Anchorage-based healthcare provider, Alaska Orthopedic Specialists, has alerted 553 patients about a breach of their protected health information. The healthcare provider is no longer in business, having closed its doors in March 2015.  While closing the business, it was discovered that a former non-physician member of staff had emailed the data of 553 patients to a personal email account, against company policy and without authorization. According to the defunct company's breach notice, efforts have been made to secure the stolen data. It is not clear whether those data have now been securely, and permanently deleted.  The theft of data was reported to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights on November 19, 2015., although it has not been made public exactly what data were stolen or when the email was sent. The data were presumably emailed to the personal email account prior to the closure of the business.  The breach notice states that no evidence of disclosure of the data has been found and neither any evidence that those data have been used inappropriately.  All affected individuals should obtain free credit reports from each of the three credit bureaus and should check entries for any sign of fraudulent activity. EoB statements should also be obtained and checked for any sign of fraud.  Individuals have been now advised of the privacy breach and have been offered credit protection services to protect against identity theft and fraud as a result of the exposure of their PHI.

hi rosalee steve asked that i forward this to you i believe that steve left you a voicemail describing the nature of the email all the best jeff forwarded by jeff dasovich na enron on pm jeff dasovich sent by jeff dasovich pm to jdasovic enron com skean enron com richard shapiro na enron enron james d steffes na enron enron cc subject forwarded by jeff dasovich na enron on pm jeff dasovich sent by jeff dasovich pm to jdasovic enron com cc subject jim it was a pleasure speaking with you on wednesday based on our conversation this email includes the following an enron contact to discuss developing small scale generation on tribal lands our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on how to remove those impediments a description of the credit issues that continue to impede dwr s ability to sign contracts with power suppliers and options to resolve them two possible options for addressing the credit issue are a california puc order clarifying that dwr will recover its power purchase costs through rates and an amendment to ab x designed to accomplish the same goal i have attached talking points regarding the california puc order and proposed amendments to ab x we believe that an amendment to ab x is the preferable option our assessment of the supply demand picture in california our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near and long term electricity crisis in california we will deliver to your office tomorrow detailed legislative language in those materials we will also identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed language i hope that the information is useful please do not hesitate to contact me if you would like to discuss these materials further or if there is anything else that i can do to assist you regards ken contact information to discuss interest expressed by native american tribes in installing small scale generation on tribal lands david parquet vice president enron north america california street suite san francisco ca phone fax key barriers to distributed generation excessive and unnecessary utility stand by charges solution the executive orders issued by the governor on february th took a step in the right direction utility stand by charges have always been designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position extract monopoly prices from customers or both but there is no reason to limit the elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than mw these limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for california to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduce the risk of black outs this summer we would propose lifting the cap by offering amendments to sb x which is designed to facilitate development of distributed generation excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with investor owned and municipal utilities solution the governor s executive order regarding interconnection is a step in the right direction d d requires utilities to complete interconnection studies within days california should ensure that this requirement applies to all generation facilities including distributed generation in addition the financial conflicts the utilities face when interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome through executive orders or other regulations to the greatest extent possible california should shift control over interconnection away from the utility and place that control with the california iso this could be accomplished through amendments to sb x permitting and air quality issues developers of distributed i e on site generation that is mws or greater must receive certification from the california energy commission and therefore face all of the impediments to development that large scale generation faces solution california should ensure that the executive orders d thru d issued by the governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant output apply equally to smaller scale distributed generation facilities in addition distributed generation that is less than mws continues to face local opposition the state should ensure that local parochial interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects these objectives could be accomplished through amendments to sb x credit concerns regarding authority granted to dwr in ab x to purchase electricity on behalf of the utilities enron responded to the rfp issued by dwr to enter into power contracts with suppliers enron is in active discussions with dwr to establish contract terms with the goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible however ambiguities contained in ab x have created significant credit risk concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms we understand that the lion s share of counterparties share enron s credit risk concerns enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and is working with dwr to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements going forward summary of the source of the credit risk issue ambiguous ratemaking authority the language in ab x is ambiguous as to whether dwr has any authority to charge california ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power from our analysis of the bill the language in ab x appears to leave intact the california puc s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in california as such suppliers have no assurance that the puc will agree to include in rates adequate charges to cover dwr s costs of power purchases ambiguous regulatory authority regarding contract prudence the language in ab x leaves open the possibility that the california public utilities commission could determine that power purchases made by dwr are imprudent on the basis of such a finding the cpuc could then refuse to allow dwr to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases consequently suppliers have no assurance that the puc will agree to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that dwr has entered into with suppliers ambiguous language regarding the ratemaking mechanism that will be used to recover dwr s costs of power purchases in addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific ratemaking mechanics that ab x directs the puc to employ to permit dwr to recover its power purchase costs based on our analysis it is extremely difficult to determine how the puc would design the rates to ensure dwr recovers its power purchase costs moreover as currently drafted it is difficult to determine whether ab x would even permit the puc to include in rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover dwr s power purchase costs again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that dwr will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power options to resolve concerns regarding credit risk we have been working diligently with dwr officials to resolve the credit risk issues we have identified three options amend ab x the amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the puc would accept as prudent and reasonable all purchase costs incurred by dwr and b the puc is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that dwr fully recovers its costs of power purchases this is the preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political challenges standing in the way of amending ab x see attached file entitled amendab x doc clarify the ambiguities in ab x through an order issued by the puc and through contract language this is the option that we are currently working with dwr officials to implement however it is more complicated and could take significantly more time to implement than the legislative fix we have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the california puc would need to issue under this option see attached file entitled cpuctalkingpoints doc make use of other instruments designed to address credit risk as indicated in our letter responding to dwr s rfp we are willing to accept other forms of credit from dwr those options include a letter of credit cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral dwr officials have indicated to us that dwr prefers to pursue the second options that is dwr prefers to clarify the ambiguities in ab x through a puc order and through contract amendments california s supply demand picture heading into summer both the california energy commission and cambridge energy research associates cera a private sector energy think tank have issued reports showing that california faces a severe supply demand imbalance they differ only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available all credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the summer of and that unless a solution is found immediately blackouts are likely cec and cera both forecast that california will be short of supply this summer by approximately mw these numbers are in line with our estimates california s supply base currently has a capacity margin well below the average which is recommended for reliable system operation in the west since the west relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power than other regions reserves are particularly important owing to the unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the west has experienced to date in the event of a low rain and snow period the system must possess the flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply california s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this requirement other reasons for reduced supply for the summer of include the early draw down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage california s severe supply demand gap emissions restrictions on existing plants and a reduced number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the utilities cambridge energy research associates asserts that at the current pace of siting permitting and construction adequate supplies will not be added to correct the market imbalance until at the earliest cera predicts that california is likely to face approximately hours of rolling black outs this summer the cec paints a considerably more optimistic scenario betting that california will bring an additional mws on line to meet peaking summer demand it is our view that california should view the cec s rosy scenario with considerable skepticism suggested package of legislative proposals designed to solve california s electricity crisis this email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution we will deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals as we have suggested throughout the crisis any solution to california s crisis must focus on four issues increase supply decrease demand establish a truly competitive retail electricity market return california s investor owned utilities to solvency increase supply legislative vehicle sb x sher to site and construct a power plant in texas takes approximately years enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less than a year in california it takes about six years or longer the governor s executive orders and senator sher s siting reform legislation are steps in the right direction our suggested amendments can improve those efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit requirements included in the cec s certification requirements enron s proposal seeks to streamline the process for obtaining credits and transfering credits between air districts in addition it creates an innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund emissions in advance of obtaining certification and permits the affected air districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the required reductions in pollution emissions decrease demand legislative vehicle ab x wright because of the delay in getting a solution in place in california closing the supply demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer this can be accomplished most effectively and quickly in two ways buy down demand california is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the general fund to finance dwr s power purchases california could likely reduce demand more economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses would be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period e g through the summer months dwr could easily run an on line auction to determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions to participate businesses would be required to have the metering equipment necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the reductions enron has developed an on line auction software package deal bench that it would be willing to contribute to the effort use price signals to incent voluntary curtailment to be successful customers need access to the following key elements an internet based hour ahead price posting system to track the market price for hour ahead power in real time real time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment verification settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be paid for load reduction negawatts the potential benefits of an effective demand response program would include creation of additional summer peaking capacity in california particularly in the short term without requiring construction of additional generation resources reduction of peak or super peak load on the over stressed california electric system thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity in the state fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full risk of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for responding we estimate that we could generate a summer on peak demand response in excess of mw during certain high cost hours and a demand response for summer on peak hours that could exceed mw we further estimate that the market response to this program from all esps could be to times that amount we recommend that the state of california provide rebates directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and control systems that would support load curtailment implementation establish a truly competitive retail electricity market legislative vehicle sb x the only customers who were protected from price volatility in san diego were customers who chose direct access and signed fixed price deals with energy service providers ironically ab x takes that important option away from customers and businesses it is critical that ab x be amended to remove the prohibition against direct access enron s legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a direct access transaction while simultaneously addressing the department of water resources concerns about stranded power costs that might result from customer migration in addition california will only achieve a competitive retail market when the utility is removed completely from the procurement function procurement is not a utility core competency as evidenced by the dire financial condition in which the utilities now find themselves california should therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement function entirely with the goal of having all customers served by a non utility provider within months to execute the transition california should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the month period in which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments of utility load return california s investor owned utilities to solvency legislative vehicle ab x utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand in short bankruptcy does nothing to solve california s supply demand imbalance in addition bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having california state government assume the role of electricity buyer for an extended period of time finally bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidence in california s energy markets and the private sector s willingness to participate in that market california can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a series of staged rate increases california should design those rate increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without shocking the economy or household budgets for example california could amortize the recovery of the utilities past debt over a year period in addition the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways first the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in recognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of ab second california can net the revenues the utilities have received from selling electricity into the power exchange against the debts they have accrued due to the retail price

"Based on Iron Mountains internal investigation conducted by members of its Global Security group, Iron Mountain believes some of the missing files were stolen through the actions of two individuals who were employees of Cornerstone Records Management, a company acquired by Iron Mountain. One of the two resigned in October 2013, when Iron Mountain acquired Cornerstone, and the second individuals employment was terminated by Iron Mountain in June 2014. Iron Mountain has determined that the vast majority of the missing storage records were x-ray files. As a result of this incident, Iron Mountain also conducted an audit of LBIMGs other records in storage, and determined that other records in storage with its predecessor, Cornerstone, were missing when Cornerstone vacated a storage facility in 2010. LBIMG has determined that some of these additional records included patient fee ticket records. Iron Mountain has notified us there is no information to indicate that the fee ticket records have been accessed or used by any unauthorized individual.  We are monitoring Iron Mountains continuing investigation of this matter. Iron Mountain is working in conjunction with the Riverside Police Department to investigate this matter, and Iron Mountain has requested that the theft of X-rays be criminally prosecuted. We have not received any indication from the Riverside Police Department that any information has been accessed or used by any unauthorized individual. UPDATE:  Rogue employees at Iron Mountain who victimized patients of Orthopaedic Specialty Institute Medical Group, Long Beach Internal Medical Group, and The Hand Care Center / Shoulder and Elbow Institute also victimized 2,691 patients of Riverside Medical Clinic.

peer reviews of pricewaterhousecoopers llp and one of its predecessors coopers lybrand llp a peer review of coopers lybrand stated the firm had extensive appropriate policies for preventing conflicts of interest while several cases were found in which people at the firm weren t notified about new clients with which they may have a conflict turner said pricewaterhouse wasn t taken to task in a peer review of its standards turner said though the accounting firm settled sec charges that executives and the firm s pension fund compromised its independence by holding stock in more than audit clients we strongly recommend that the pob undertake a special review of possible independence violations turner wrote to bowsher a month later in january pricewaterhouse released a consultant s report saying independence violations were discovered at the firm we did a very extensive review and put new systems in place a couple of years ago to alert employees about stock holdings that present a conflict of interest pricewaterhouse spokesman david nestor said the wall street journal wednesday reported turner s comments about pricewaterhouse and coopers a systematic failure the released letters show the

clients the aicpa is the industry s professional group firms auditing public companies may lack sufficient worldwide quality controls to assure their independence from audit clients turner wrote in the dec letter the sec staff has identified additional troubling examples that suggest not only a lack of sufficient global safeguards but also a systematic failure by professionals within certain firms to adhere to even their own firm s existing controls last year turner expressed disappointment that aicpa failed to take any disciplinary actions in some cases where the sec had found violations in a feb letter turner faulted the aicpa s disciplinary process for a lack of public accountability and reporting mutual back scratching the sec chief accountant said there was a perception within the industry that partners in large accounting firms are treated more leniently in the disciplinary process than other accountants a march letter expressed concern that the peer review process is little more than mutual back scratching in another letter dated april turner said during the past three years an alarming number of deficiencies and in some cases outright lack of quality controls within the accounting profession with respect to auditor s independence have been brought to the attention of the staff the sec letters span the debate over an sec proposal to bar accounting firms from many

ljm hastened enron s collapse control of more than million may be at stake in the suit to remove kopper the court papers don t say and lawyers on both sides declined to comment investors could be left with nothing if the partnership s assets are pulled into enron s bankruptcy case lawyers said creditors are likely to make a move on anything left in this partnership in which enron has an interest said chuck tatelbaum a naples florida attorney representing two enron companies with claims against enron in the bankruptcy case fastow set up dozens of private partnerships to buy and sell enron assets kopper worked with fastow at enron to help market some of the partnerships to investors and left the company to run ljm according to company filings and court records partnership assets fastow formed ljm in and the partnership acquired energy and telecommunications assets from enron including an mile fiber optic network it bought in june in a transaction that resulted in a million profit for enron ljm sold the network six months later for a million profit according to documents enron filed with the u s securities and exchange commission mr fastow and mr kopper are the architects of controversies that led to enron s bankruptcy michael goldman a wilmington lawyer representing the suing ljm limited partners said at a jan hearing in the case mr kopper has interests that are in conflict with both the partnership and the limited partners goldman told chancery court judge jack b jacobs in seeking to bar kopper from controlling the partnership while the case is litigated feb trial jacobs ordered kopper on jan to hand over the partnership s reins to turnaround specialist jay alix associates and make all books papers and records available to the firm pending a trial due to begin feb kopper and his lawyers didn t return calls seeking comment on the suit in court papers kopper said the investors who are trying to remove him violated the partnership agreement he said investors like citigroup inc s citicorp and the travelers indemnity co which agreed to invest million and million in ljm respectively missed a jan deadline for providing funds owed the partnership that included their share of a million interest payment he said the loan is now in default he added the partnership agreement prevents them from banding together to force out the general partner because they defaulted on those payments kopper said we intend to continue serving as the general partner of the partnership with the goal as always of maximizing asset value for the partners kopper said in a jan letter to the partners a copy was included in the court file partnership agreement lawyers for the partners suing kopper said in court papers that they ve complied with the partnership agreement s requirements for ousting the general partner limited partners with a combined investment of more than percent of the partnership voted to remove kopper the lawyers said kopper has refused to acknowledge his removal and has taken numerous acts to jeopardize the partnership and the limited partners goldman said at the jan hearing before jacobs according to a transcript for example kopper is trying to direct defense lawyers representing ljm in a dozen suits in texas state court over deals involving the partnership enron and other enron related units joseph mclaughlin a new york based lawyer representing limited partners noted in court papers plaintiffs believe that immediate removal of michael kopper is needed to ensure that the partnership and its limited partners receive adequate and conflict free representation in the suits mclaughlin said in the filing raiding allegation kopper also raided the partnership s accounts after learning of the bid to remove him partners allege in court papers the day before limited partners voted to force him out kopper transferred million from the partnership to pay half his annual management fee though he was only owed about the partners alleged he also took improper steps to disqualify the partners they said the limited partners including some of the largest financial institutions in this country want to stop the bleeding and the threats of mr kopper goldman told jacobs among other investors who agreed to invest in lmj are the american home assurance co million the arkansas teachers retirement system million aig

first public appearance as enron corp s new chief executive stephen cooper spoke in the firm tones that lived up to his reputation as a no nonsense kind of guy i do not see this as a liquidation he said adding that his view historically has been that creditors receive more cents on dollar when a company reorganizes than when it liquidates regardless of how effectively you run that liquidation there is a patina of distress cooper said people will attempt to put you over a barrel by cooper s account enron will emerge as a smaller company one without the powerful energy trading operation that became its identity but a survivor nonetheless his task now is to move in and organize but while cooper is keeping the faith that enron will be able to reorganize creditors appear to be losing their confidence they wish him well but believe that he ll have to overcome significant odds to get enron back on its feet i ve got the highest regard for steve cooper you can t really be a bankruptcy professional and not know him or know of his reputation said scott baena an attorney at bilzin sumberg dunn baena price axelrod llp in miami baena whose firm represents a group of former enron employees said he believes cooper is intent on reorganizing even though it s too soon to know if this is possible for steve cooper reorganization is an aspirational goal but we don t always get what we want baena said cooper has more than years experience in leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations he will be joined in his efforts by professionals from the restructuring consultancy zolfo cooper llc that he helped create that experience carries clout and that could make a difference in the case i think his appointment makes it less likely that a trustee will be appointed said richard tilton a new york bankruptcy lawyer judge arthur gonzalez who is presiding over enron s bankruptcy is likely to deem the appointment of an independent trustee to take over enron s daily operations as excessively disruptive to already complex court proceedings according to tilton it s more likely he said that the judge will name an examiner to probe certain aspects of fraud or misdeed in the case to be sure enron s bankruptcy the largest in u s history will likely remain prominent in the public eye as long as congress continues its numerous investigations turnarounds are always sensitive matters but it is rare for the reorganizational efforts to be this public cooper s experience may help him make the quick decisions that will be needed to tackle the job but creditors will be looking for results fast according to charlie rhoads a partner at the houston office of boyden global executive search there is no honeymoon period because an interim ceo really falls under the role of a consultant he said explaining that there is less patience for results from an individual with this type of experience on wednesday cooper gave a rough outline of his plan and in it the new enron looked very much like old pipeline company that gave birth to the original enron the company would retain its gas pipelines and would assess whether to preserve or sell the rest the businesses that might be sold include money losing power plants in india and brazil enron s broadband assets and the water and wastewater business that were once part of azurix corp one way to do this would be to combine the assets and the liabilities of all enron subsidiaries this move called a substantive consolidation would put some creditors at a disadvantage and result in them getting paid less for their claims with this in mind some creditors have petitioned the court to segregate the cash flowing into one of enron s units because they claim the parent company can t be trusted to keep accurate records and divvy up the funds among the business units the creditors want detailed accounts of the cash flows into enron units given enron s legal structure cooper believes it is highly probable that not all creditors will be treated equally in other words in the end there just might not be enough to pay off all creditors after the web of off balance sheet partnerships are untangled

silly season is in full bloom in particular any attempt to tie enron and the california energy crisis of a year ago into a unifying theory on the evils of deregulation grabs big headlines so what if there isn t an important connection never let the facts stand in the way of a good story especially with so much money on the line and an election to win at senate energy committee hearings tuesday an energy consultant from the northwest robert mccullough made a reasonable pitch for more transparency in energy markets and for enforced disclosure of all corporations off balance sheet subsidiaries but mccullough a registered republican in favor of electricity deregulation supplied the democratic party with a plum almost as a side note mccullough said that forward prices for wholesale electricity in the northwest fell when enron filed chapter on dec the clear implication is that enron may have been using its market dominance to set forward prices he surmised the rest of mccullough s testimony was shunted aside outraged senators dianne feinstein d calif ron wyden d calif and maria cantwell d wash demanded congressional hearings and a federal investigation into this new revelation nasty enron had been manipulating the power market right up until the day it declared bankruptcy it must have been the culprit behind the western electricity crisis a year ago where there s smoke there s fire cantwell said investigations were launched and wednesday s newspapers across the country ran with headlines like enron witness raises specter of price fixing someone tell the traders western energy traders meanwhile grunted a collective huh the people in the market every day don t remember a price collapse like that at the time of enron s bankruptcy filing what is he talking about asked one if senators or their staff had bothered to look at the prices mccullough submitted with his testimony they might have questioned his math mccullough s data taken from trade publisher platt s show power prices in washington state for through falling from a megawatt hour before enron s bankruptcy filing to mwh days later that s a drop not a drop platt s immediately disowned the figure as well as the consultant s explanation for the modest decline in an interview thursday mccullough said his figure came from confidential bids he obtained for clients not from the platt s prices he submitted his bids fell from mwh the week before enron s filing to mwh the week after the fundamental question is what happened that weekend that enron declared bankruptcy he said will we know what happened more if it s or i don t think so the size of the move might not mean that much to mccullough but this is an election year and california gov gray davis is facing an uphill race for reelection because of his handling of the energy crisis though prices and blackout fears have long since receded the state is stuck with some billion in overpriced long term contracts negotiated by his appointees democratic senators saw an opportunity to lay the blame for davis mismanagement on yet another scapegoat first it was the merchant generators fault but then it turned out they charged much lower prices than california s municipal utilities then it was el paso corp ep accused of withholding supply to drive up prices of natural gas now it s enron the democrats must deflect all blame from davis in s most important single race what really happened so why did northwest electricity prices fall even at the time of enron s bankruptcy the price history submitted by mccullough backs up what traders have been saying for months enron had been seen shorting western power since last spring making money as prices collapsed that view was confirmed this week by the bonneville power administration the federal power marketer in the northwest a year ago enron was selling to bonneville at an average price of mwh later enron bought the power back at about according to bonneville in october as enron s credit quality and survival were being severely questioned the company ordered its traders to flatten their books for enron s western traders that meant getting out of their short positions by buying back power to reduce the risks in their portfolio prices rebounded for a few weeks on enron s buying but that stopped in early november after enron became unable to do many more deals the bear market for all u s energy markets which has continued to this day resumed for western power aside from the politics we re talking big bucks several western utilities hold hundreds of millions of dollars in long term contracts with enron that are now way above the market those contracts didn t go away with enron s bankruptcy filing just the opposite they became major assets of the estate if they hold up the utilities will have to pay the entire difference between their contracts and the current market up front in cash if the utilities can prove enron manipulated the market they might be able to get federal energy regulators to invalidate the contracts even high priced contracts signed with suppliers other than enron like davis might be nullified based on enron s market manipulation as for feinstein s rush to judge enron as the culprit behind california s energy crisis mccullough called that a leap of faith that crisis was in the spot market for power needed on a daily and hourly basis as big as enron was it was never big enough to control the spot market for western electricity which was enormous until california started buying everything under long term contracts last summer for all its questionable activities enron isn t to blame for california the state botched deregulation under the leadership of the previous governor republican pete wilson the davis ignored the crisis for eight months until after the state s two largest utilities were flat broke and then largely botched the solution end of story not a chance mccullough is

street recovery gail fosler chief economist of the u s conference board said the enron implosion following the collapse of stocks of companies such as xerox corp and lucent technologies inc definitely has the world s investors wondering where the bad news will stop i wouldn t call it the enron contagion but it does undergird the sense of risk aversion that was already in play she said adding that the scandal has also hurt other companies seeking to take on debt to survive hard times i would even say kmart was a victim of enron she said adding that there was a broad tightening of credit when

of the world s corporate leaders have laid off workers outsourced non core businesses and imposed travel restrictions although not necessarily their and up rooms at the waldorf astoria the survey found that the ceos regarded these cutbacks as long term although they believed that budgets for research and development would be restored perhaps most interesting though is that globalization

following enron scandal by seth sutel ap business writer associated press newswires copyright the associated press all rights reserved new york ap stung by a collapse in public confidence following the enron scandal the accounting profession is taking steps to eliminate the appearance of conflicts of interest in the kinds of services they offer their audit clients the american institute of certified public accountants a professional group said friday for the first time that it would support any future proposal to impose certain limits on services accounting firms may provide to the companies they audit the statement came a day after kpmg one of the five major accounting firms reversed its opposition to limits proposed two years ago which would have prevented auditing firms from providing information technology consulting or internal audit services to the companies whose financial statements they audit the two actions came on the heels of an announcement from the leading accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers that it would spin off its consulting business into a separate entity the plans which had been in the works for many months were accelerated because of concerns that the public perception of the accounting profession was hurting because of the enron scandal enron s auditor arthur andersen llp acknowledged destroying documents and e mails that were sought by federal and congressional investigators looking into questionable accounting practices which led to the swift collapse last fall of the energy trading giant the non audit consulting fees are often much more lucrative to the accounting firms than fees for auditing companies books for example in the walt disney co paid pricewaterhousecoopers million for its auditing and million for other services according to its proxy statement critics contend the high fees could taint an auditor s objectivity when reviewing its client s books on thursday disney said it will not use its outside auditing firm for new consulting projects and will review those currently under way linda dunbar a spokeswoman for the aicpa said that even though the group would support future limits on the bans that such restrictions were not the solution to the profession s problems and would not prevent the next enron given where we are on public concerns on conflict of interest it seems that some restrictions are necessary so that we can move on to more substantive issues dunbar said likewise stephen g butler chairman of kpmg called the controversy of service limits a red herring in a statement released thursday but he said the firm would now support the limits in order to move on to substantive reform of financial accounting practices spokesmen for pricewaterhousecoopers and ernst young two of the other five major accounting firms both said their firms supported the limits on information and internal auditing consulting when they were first proposed two years ago under arthur levitt the former chairman of the securities and exchange commission and that their position hadn t changed when this was being debated two years ago we supported it then and we support it now larry parnell a spokesman for ernst young said this is not a new position for us peter horowitz a spokesman for pricewaterhousecoopers said we supported those positions two years ago a spokesman for andersen didn t return a phone call seeking comment the new york times quoted an andersen official as saying that his firm would make an announcement soon that would substantially change the way andersen does business deloitte touche released a statement thursday calling the issue over the scope of services that accounting firms can offer principally one of perception but it is a huge perception problem nonetheless the firm said it is premature to accept or reject any proposal whether we agree with it or not because the effectiveness of a complete set of reforms is what ultimately needs to be assessed auditing firms can still provide certain non auditing services to the firms they audit subject to certain rules but most accounting firms have already separated from their consulting divisions including andersen whose consulting arm split off into a unit called accenture kpmg has spun off its consulting business and in early ernst young sold its consulting business to cap gemini sa a french computer and management services company once pricewaterhousecoopers stock offering is complete deloitte will remain the only major accounting firm that is still united with its consulting arm copyright dow jones company inc all rights reserved top of the news enron a house divided dan ackman forbes com am et divide and conquer is often a winning strategy enron s wrinkle has long been divide and disavow and it seems that for the bankrupt energy trader and its lawyers old gambits die hard one of the principal components of the enron scandal was the company s practice of creating partnerships and then using them to push its assets or debts off its books technically this can be legal so long as the partnerships are truly separate which among other things means that outside investors control as little as of the partnership equity the myth of separation while still strongly believed by enron itself is losing support among the accounting firms who have been tainted by enron and other recent scandals the big five accounting firms are coming around to the idea that providing certain consulting services to the same company it is auditing creates an inherent conflict and is bad business until recently the accounting profession bitterly opposed any limits on its consulting services beating back rule changes proposed by arthur levitt when he was chairman of the securities and exchange commission but the enron taint has spread past enron s own auditor arthur andersen and the firms are seeking to police themselves lest others such as the sec do it for them pricewaterhousecoopers and kpmg said yesterday said they would support such proposals andersen itself is said to be leaning in that direction and that it will soon announce substantial changes in how it does business the walt disney co approved of the new regime of separation yesterday when its chairman michael eisner said the company would not use its independent auditor pricewaterhousecoopers for any new consulting work and would evaluate the current projects the accounting firm s consultants are currently doing for the company disney in paid pricewaterhousecoopers million in audit fees and around million in non audit fees pricewaterhousecoopers for its part said it intended to spin off its consulting arm in an ipo which could mollify disney and others arthur andersen in separated from its old consulting arm now known as accenture after a long running dispute between the two sides of the firm but since then andersen itself has beefed up its own consulting practice according to a report in the new york times just over half the million it billed enron in was for consulting enron of course has fired its auditor as if andersen forced enron s hand rather than the other way around and it appears to be clinging to its old religion at least in the early innings of the enron investigation sen byron dorgan d n d accused the company yesterday of failing to provide records for thousands of enron backed partnerships that were long known to and approved by company directors dorgan is chairman of the senate commerce subcommittee on consumer affairs one of nine congressional panels probing enron a lawyer for enron robert bennett responded to reporters the senator is terribly misinformed we have been totally cooperating with the committee bennett added the senator may be operating under the misimpression that we have possession of many of these special partnership entity documents which we don t the documents would have to be obtained from the partnerships themselves instead of one subpoena bennett wants dorgan to issue in the unique dialect native to planet enron this stance is called cooperation dorgan obviously acting without the benefit of a translator was confused virtually all of these partnerships would be enron and someone else he said you d certainly expect you would have all of the records at your fingertips as a corporation but not having the records the right hand not knowing what the left hand was doing was increasingly how enron did business the enron board as dorgan pointed out had to approve the creation of the partnerships the chairman of that board kenneth lay is scheduled to testify before a congressional committee on feb bennett told reporters lay will appear before the committee he s not going to plead the fifth mr lay feels he has nothing to hide and that he s done nothing wrong and he wants to tell his story but bennett represents enron not lay personally lay s lawyer in washington d c is earl silbert silbert did not return phone calls

kenneth lay s instructions on how the white house should handle last year s electricity crisis by anthony york salon com feb the release of a memo from then enron ceo kenneth lay to vice president dick cheney that included recommendations for how to handle the california energy crisis is encouraging the state s top politicians to call for more hearings and investigations into enron s role on

writing to request an additional hearing to pursue what role enron had in the california energy crisis with respect to market manipulation and price gouging feinstein wrote in her letter to bingaman enron s ability to deal in complex unregulated financial derivatives in the natural gas market while controlling a tremendous share of the gas trading market provided enron the ability to manipulate market prices critics say enron was a big part of why the california energy marketplace was fundamentally flawed in the first place enron argued for a separate clearinghouse for all energy trades in the state which had little regulatory scrutiny and operated in virtual secrecy that consumer advocates say helped energy producers and traders like enron to artificially manipulate the market and gouge the utilities who were buying the wholesale energy to deliver to their retail customers bill wicker spokesman for the energy committee says the chairman has not yet set a date for those hearings but the interest of feinstein as well as democrats maria cantwell of washington and ron wyden of oregon in holding such hearings is a good sign they will be held soon the lay memo a copy of which was leaked to the san francisco chronicle refocused attention on enron s role in the california energy crisis lay gave cheney the two page document in april as the two met to discuss california s situation and the formation of a new national energy policy the memo outlines enron s priorities for a national energy plan and includes suggestions for how to solve the state s energy problems critics say it illustrates just how closely the administration s final plan mirrors enron s priorities sen barbara boxer called the memo a smoking gun eight remedies for the energy problems in california are listed in the memo which lay gave to cheney on april including a recommendation to give private companies the power of eminent domain to seize private property to build new power plants or transmission lines the memo also argues strenuously against implementing price caps on wholesale energy prices a key issue in the california energy crisis instead enron argued the solution to the crisis should be more deregulation not less that closely mirrored cheney s public comments the day after his meeting with lay as politicians from both parties were calling for temporary caps events in california and in other parts of the country demonstrated that the benefits of competition have yet to be realized and have not yet reached consumers the memo states the administration should reject any attempt to re regulate wholesale power markets by adopting price caps on april cheney told the los angeles times california is looked on by many folks as a classic example of the kinds of problems that arise when you do use price caps while the memo does not shed a tremendous amount of new light on lay and enron s input lay met with cheney six times as the administration was crafting its energy plan it underscored once again how enron had the administration s ear at a time when california was threatened with soaring energy prices and rolling blackouts lay it appears had better access than california s highest elected officials throughout the crisis i was not allowed a private interview with the president or vice president even though such a talk may have helped california sen dianne feinstein wrote in a recent editorial in the los angeles times something is wrong when a senator representing million californians is not able to talk personally to the president or vice president in the midst of a crisis but executives from a company that contributed millions of campaign dollars have complete access and significant influence boxer is expected to confront lay with the memo when lay testifies before the senate commerce committee on monday feinstein and boxer have directed most of their outrage at the administration for refusing to hear the pleas of democrats and republicans from california who begged for price caps on the state s out of control wholesale energy prices the administration refused adopting the same position as enron that price caps even if imposed on a temporary basis will be detrimental to power markets and will discourage private investment in the words of the enron memo eventually new federal energy regulatory commission chairman pat wood acquiesced and imposed limited price caps on wholesale energy prices in the golden state those caps along with other factors including increased energy conservation and a cooler than expected summer out west led to an easing of the state s energy crisis as wholesale energy prices fell the rising political heat combined with vice president cheney s continued refusal to cooperate with the general accounting office s request for his notes from those energy policy meetings is encouraging consumer advocates to up the ante doug heller from the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights speculates that cheney may be refusing to cooperate with the gao because he s trying to cover up for his buddies at enron who heller says artificially manipulated california s energy market it seems clear now that enron needed the ability to gouge california to keep their company going he says the big question now is did lay ever say to cheney we re in trouble and we need to keep this thing going in california to pay off our debts cheney has repeatedly said that he and lay never discussed enron s financial troubles but heller says the vice president s intransigence calls that into question i

provide some help but the gathering this week in the capitol held before a clutch of television cameras also underscored an effort by democrats to gain election year strength from the enron debacle enron has the potential to shape the entire political environment for impact other issues and reduce confidence in the bush administration and republicans three prominent democratic advisers wrote in a memo widely circulated in congress this week the more people hear the more corrosive it becomes wrote james carville stanley greenberg and bob shrum there s some risk to the strategy since democrats were counted among the top recipients of enron related campaign donations and for their part republicans are taking steps to minimize any damage president bush has made a series of comments critical of enron whose former chairman kenneth lay was a longtime campaign supporter corporate america must be made accountable to employees and shareholders and held to the highest standards of conduct the president said in tuesday night s state of the union address but even before the strategy memo surfaced senior democrats had begun making frequent mention of the bankrupt energy company in ways designed to raise doubts about the bush administration and gop i think we are slowly enronizing the economy enronizing the budget senate majority leader tom daschle recently told reporters linking last year s white house backed tax cuts to the imminent reappearance of federal budget deficits we are taking the same approach enron used in sapping retirement funds and providing them to those at the very top house democratic leader dick gephardt of missouri mentioned enron explicitly in the democratic response to the state of the union address if the nation s largest bankruptcy coupled with a clear example of paid political influence isn t a prime case for reform i don t know what is gephardt said the forces aligned against this are powerful he said most democrats support legislation to reduce the role of money in politics gop leaders oppose it and democrats have long labored to depict republicans as beholden to special interests the polling on enron is somewhat murky but murky isn t all that bad for the democrats given that bush s approval ratings are in the percent range and that the sept terrorist attacks have elevated public concern about defense issues which tend to favor republicans polling also shows that republicans gained a boost in hypothetical election matchups for congress in the wake of last fall s terrorist attacks but democrats seized on a recent new york times survey suggesting that the public sees republicans as being more closely linked to enron than the democrats percent to percent democrats have been heartened as well by the decision by the general accounting office the congressional watchdog agency led by a republican to sue for records of vice president dick cheney s energy task force i applaud gao for standing up for the principles of the right of congress and the people to know who helped shape the administration s energy policy said rep john dingell d mich who helped initiate the gao investigation last april alongside the inquiry into the task force a dozen congressional committees are investigating enron the party s ability to gain political ground said one house democratic leadership aide speaking on condition of anonymity is a question of how aggressive the senate people are who have subpoenas thus far republicans profess little concern it s an issue that has to be directly addressed the american people expect it said sen bill frist r tenn chairman of the senate gop campaign committee but with bush scoring well in the polls one republican strategist said the gop need merely be properly outraged where outrage is warranted democrats may hurt themselves if they place too much stress on enron and its ties to the republicans this official said much like republicans paid a price at the polls in when they sought to make the impeachment of president clinton a campaign centerpiece yet in their memo carville greenberg and shrum suggested how democrats could use the enron collapse politically referring to the first of two economic stimulus bills that republicans pushed through the house last year they wrote it is easy to imagine a chain of argument an economic stimulus bill that became a corporate giveaway

and could help push trade in those commodities to regulated exchanges said david vitale president and chief executive of the chicago board of trade over the counter energy markets have clear benefits including increased flexibility and lower costs to participate vitale said speaking late thursday at a chicago conference but enron s rapid decline and withdrawal from those markets which it once dominated exposed the over the counter markets significant risks he said enron clearly brings proof that those risks are real vitale said the otc market is clearly a buyer beware market natural gas contracts like oil contracts are already traded heavily on the new york mercantile exchange in addition to over the counter markets but electricity contracts change hands almost exclusively in over the counter markets that handled by one estimate nearly billion in trade in in an interview following the conference vitale said he expects more exchange traded energy contracts to emerge following enron s fall though the cbot has no specific plans to roll out such products it s something the exchange will explore he said it s on the agenda to look at he said energy traders generally managed to unwind their enron contracts with minimal disruption but enron s troubles show there can be tremendous risk management costs for over the counter market participants vitale said with those over the counter market costs and risks now apparent regulated markets which can offer standard contracts more liquidity and the safety net of clearing functions appear more favorable he said the expected costs of participating in the otc markets will rise vitale said there will be a flight to quality any attempt to shift electricity trading to regulated markets faces significant challenges transmission constraints that limit the ability to move power to where it is needed most make electricity a regional product traded in a wide array of contracts centered on major transmission hubs around the u s it would be hard to create a standard contract for that system vitale said nymex launched electricity futures five years ago but they are almost never traded exchanges and energy companies are pursuing other routes however that could bring the risk mitigation benefits of a regulated exchange to over the counter electricity markets nymex for example began offering clearing services to over the counter natural gas markets last november and wants to offer clearing to power traders in intercontinentalexchange a major internet based marketplace backed by several large

actually highlighted the strengths of the energy markets while enron created a headache for counterparties those companies still managed to quickly eject enron from the markets in what wood called a

launched the first mutual fund to invest exclusively in companies with significant employee ownership headquartered in the same city as enron houston based capstone asset management recently introduced the capstone employee stock ownership fund a no load portfolio investing primarily in u s companies with broad based employee stock ownership programs one of the things that really makes this an opportune time for the fund is the situation at enron in that the notion of employee ownership has been tarnished by what happened but it wasn t employee ownership that was the problem argued fund manager dan e watson so how will watson keep from ending up with a portfolio chock full of enrons after starting with a field of some companies that offer stock ownership to more than half of their employees watson hopes to cull the list down to to solid companies using both quantitative and bottom up analysis they re very attractive in their own right and i think that s the thing we want to emphasize that these are good investments anyway noted watson watson said however that had the fund started a year ago enron would not have been a holding as evidenced by its absence in the firm s other actively managed funds capstone itself an employee owned company cited studies by various researchers suggesting that employee stock ownership leads to improved corporate performance which could translate into improved stock market performance as well never a fan of funds with a gimmick morningstar analyst russel kinnel understands the case for these types of stocks but wouldn t hold out ownership as any sort of a barometer for quality he noted that enron is a strong example that the system isn t foolproof i would say that stock options are probably the most debatable part of the equation in that you can get some real dilution there as we re talking about accounting issues this is one where options are not counted as an expense or compensation obviously they should be kinnel observed top holdings in the fund include chip stocks like kla tencor and intel biotech concern amgen also figures prominently in the portfolio these are all good companies with bright earnings prospects in their own light and they have the other virtue of having motivated employees because of their ownership policies watson said the esop association a washington based trade organization comprised of companies with employee stock ownership plans entered into an affinity agreement with capstone to provide information about the fund to its membership the employee ownership community is very excited about capstone s new employee stock ownership fund for the first time our nation will see that the many studies evidencing superior performance by employee owned companies are real not hypothetical said association president j michael keeling the portfolio should be of particular interest to esop members already sold on the concept of employee ownership because it offers greater

subcommittee dorgan says lay the former ceo of enron has agreed to testify fully and will not be seeking any immunity deal and lou many of the executives who ran enron will also be testifying before various committees here next week including another former ceo jeff skilling who resigned unexpected only six months after assuming the top job dobbs and whose departure seems to be the incipient point of the unraveling of enron tim thank you very much tim o brien andrew sullivan s selective enron outrage the failed energy trader didn t just spend money on politicians it gave handily to journalists too but why is sullivan most angry about the one liberal who cashed in by eric boehlert salon com jan it took a few months but the press has finally managed to carve out an angle about itself in the enron debacle a controversy in a teapot focusing on conflicts of interest for the so called enron pundits the pundits include a group of prominent political and economic commentators who in recent years i e before former ceo kenneth lay replaced osama bin laden as public enemy no made their way onto enron s payroll and received big bucks for doing very little work now they are being asked how in good conscience can they comment on enron s fall after cashing lay s obscenely generous checks the enron sugar daddies include weekly standard editor william kristol cnbc host and national review online columnist lawrence kudlow new york times columnist paul krugman weekly standard contributing editor and sunday times of london columnist irwin stelzer approximately and wall street journal columnist peggy noonan apparently she cannot recall the exact sum we re assured this is a very big deal the burgeoning scandal has replaced the war as the beltway s reigning obsession the washington post reported on wednesday a review of the charges makes clear that none of the enron media players who were all slow to cop to their houston boondoggles come out looking very good but that also goes for their chief accuser conservative columnist andrew sullivan his selective prosecution raises suspicion about whether he is simply trying to right an ethical wrong or more likely hoping to damage one of the left s most effectively critical voices paul krugman a former mit economist who has landed punch after solid punch on the bush administration over the past year right from the outset sullivan using his daily online column called for an investigation into krugman s alleged ethical lapse by who the pundit police is that run out of the department of justice he suggested krugman and others recuse themselves from the enron situation the way attorney general john ashcroft did since as a senator he received enron contributions according to sullivan the times columnist should return his enron money just as senator hillary clinton had returned the campaign contributions she d received from enron in washington contributions and paychecks are seen as one and the same disclosure is a must wrote sullivan we demand it of politicians why should we not demand it of the journalists who police them if it s corrupting for politicians why is it any less corrupting for pundits who can exercise as much power as many congressmen and often have more influence than individual senators yes both politicians and the press depend on public trust but the last time we checked pundits did not have the power to pass legislation prosecute criminals or declare war nor were pundits answerable to the voters indeed the level of importance granted by the media to this enron media tempest is more proof than we need of the warped sense of self importance such pundits have about themselves and their colleagues the absurd levels of self absorption are reminiscent of the time early in george bush s campaign a boston television journalist sprang a pop quiz on a befuddled w while the cameras rolled the reporter asked him to name several foreign leaders bush stumbled badly more than a few pundits then rushed forward to defend bush suggesting even they wouldn t have been able to ace such a tough test their courage in admitting to just skimming the international news section every morning was commendable but unlike bush those columnists weren t angling to become the leader of the free world so just what crimes did these pundits commit irwin stelzer contributing editor for the weekly standard and a columnist for the sunday times of london to date stelzer still has not disclosed to readers how much he was paid to serve on an enron advisory board that he helped organize in a weekly standard piece about enron last november stelzer defended the company by stressing there was no indication that the mistakes were other than honest ones or that investors were deliberately kept in the dark or misled about the company s finances in that piece stelzer told readers about serving on the advisory board but not that he was paid tens of thousands of dollars this came after years of writing favorably about enron without giving readers a hint of his financial ties to the company bill kristol editor of the weekly standard not much better than stelzer s situation kristol collected for serving two years on the same lightweight enron advisory board while editing a weekly magazine that routinely covered energy and deregulation policies enron was actively trying to shape it wasn t until stelzer s column last november that readers were told about kristol s enron involvement just how much kristol pocketed was revealed only later by other publications if there s an ethics crime for sullivan to prosecute it s the weekly standard s nonexistent conflict of interest guidelines last week the new york times reported that ralph reed the former head of the christian coalition was given a plum per month consulting gig at enron at the request of bush strategist karl rove the clear implication being that the bush camp was trying to win over reed as an ally by using enron s payroll was a similar strategy at work with kristol kristol was not known as a bush booster he backed sen john mccain in the republican primary could the board membership have been designed as a way to quietly lead him to the bush camp only enron execs know the answer to that question peggy noonan columnist for the wall street journal the conservative opinion maker outed herself last friday in a column critical of enron and its culture of wealth she informed her readers that she d once done speechwriting for the failed houston energy company like almost everyone else involved however noonan had trouble coming right out and telling readers how much she pocketed instead she wrote that if memory serves she earned between and for her work but even those numbers were hard to come by readers had to calculate on their own the number of hours she worked between to hours and multiply that by the rate she charged in order to get the final eye popping invoice noonan then admitted the speech she wrote for enron wasn t very good and that only portions of it were even used yet going by her high end estimate of hours billed noonan spent five weeks straight working hour work weeks to deliver contributions that she conceded weren t helpful after initially criticizing noonan sullivan reversed course writing that he d been a little harsh on her and that noonan had been had and used by the energy giant some at enron might quibble with that assessment lawrence kudlow cohost of cnbc s america now and an editor for national review online kudlow earned for a year s consulting and two speaking fees in his national review column on monday kudlow claimed he had been completely forthcoming with respect to my brief consulting role with enron and the fees i received for this consulting not quite kudlow didn t reveal his generous fees until sullivan began his enron pundit watch and that was after kudlow had already written about the company without letting readers in on his enron finances when kudlow finally did come clean he explained he had been attracted by the personable kenneth lay not lay s checkbook mind you his personality that was odd because in his previous column kudlow undressed the characters at enron presumably including lay who had no moral fiber no character no courage and no corporate responsibility also worth noting is that it took kudlow several months to even address enron s page debacle that seems like an odd oversight for somebody with the title of financial economics editor did the enron money help keep kudlow quiet paul krugman columnist for the new york times this whole game of gotcha began when the new york times deep in a recent enron news story reported that krugman had once received to serve on enron s now famous advisory board months earlier krugman himself had informed readers about his enron work but conveniently left out the five figure number same was true when he wrote a puffy enron piece for fortune magazine in the advisory board was mentioned handsome paychecks were not today krugman is among enron s harshest critics sullivan s probably correct in his surmise that the numbers were originally left out because most times readers and even fortune s white collar readers would probably be stunned to read about that kind of pay for two days work but krugman who cut his enron ties when he joined the times in order to comply with the newspaper s strict conflict of interest policy flagged his association well before enron cratered which is more than any of the other pundits can say by sullivan s standards though krugman s the worst of the bunch and that s where sullivan s partisan instincts drive his accountability crusade off the track rather than calling all the pundits out for not disclosing their questionable enron paydays sullivan largely gives the other conservative commentators a pass and zeroes in on the only liberal among them for instance assessing kudlow s enron writings sullivan concluded since his pieces were harshly critical of enron there s no scandal yet no pundit this year has been as harshly critical of enron as krugman has so why is his work a scandal applying a sort of retroactive responsibility sullivan accused krugman of absconding with worth of dirty money from a criminal enterprise of course krugman took the money three years ago long before enron s problems were apparent by contrast kudlow was cashing enron checks for a speech given last august just as the company was beginning to unravel sullivan patted kristol on the back for getting his payment out in the open in the open kristol pocketed twice as much as krugman yet the weekly standard still hasn t printed any details about kristol s cushy enron payment meanwhile sullivan accused krugman and the new york times of somehow trying to cover up his enron affiliation most readers of the times would think the payment is relevant sullivan complained yet how did he find out about the he read it in the new york times later sullivan bemoaned vast amounts of corporate cash being handed over to journalists and how those vast amounts might actually give an appearance of conflict of interest for a journalist but was krugman a journalist in when enron came calling over the years the economist has undoubtedly been a prodigious writer with outlets in fortune and slate among others but to suggest krugman was a journalist the way noonan kristol kudlow or stelzer are is disingenuous in he was primarily known as a mit professor of economics who according to his own explanation accepted the enron gig based on a long tradition of high profile economics professors cashing out at the expense of corporations so why after the fact does sullivan try to hold krugman to a conflict of interest standard his future employer would insist upon was krugman supposed to know in that later in the year he d be hired by the new york times and therefore he shouldn t have accepted the enron money krugman answered his critics by claiming he was being smeared by a broader effort by conservatives to sling enron muck toward their left hoping that some of it would stick he s onto something clearly krugman s constant flurry of punches over the last year have hit the white house in the gut a few too many times for some conservatives and his punches hurt krugman is an economist who knows his topic better than the white house does he s also untainted by the clinton sex scandals he joined the times after those bloody battles had been fought and he s unusually blunt in his assessment that president bush is either a fool or a liar for pushing his tax cut strategy sullivan may have inadvertently revealed his true motivation for targeting krugman when he immediately launched another media crusade criticizing the new york times left wing lurch in its aggressive enron news coverage specifically sullivan didn t think that a poll that found a vast majority of americans felt republicans not democrats had close ties to enron was page material there is an important lesson about politics money and power to be learned from the enron pundit tale but it s not necessarily the one that sullivan is shouting about the five dumbest things on wall street this week by george mannes senior writer thestreet com am est where was adam schiff s sage counsel when we needed it most a thousand apologies to andersen attorney nancy temple of whom we made fun last week for her small but noteworthy role in enron s ongoing accounting debacle as you may recall we chided temple s need not to know behavior her response to an urgent email about whether enron might mislead the public in an impending earnings release temple s impulse apparently wasn t actually to be helpful but to ask the questioner to keep her name out of all correspondence so she wouldn t have to testify well as the five dumbest things in house counsel informed us this week temple did the right thing as squirrelly as it might seem to the layperson ralph the lawyer tells us it s standard operating procedure for an attorney to tell a client not to blab to the world about conversations they ve had because that s a sure way to lose the sacred attorney client privilege of confidentiality any half decent lawyer we pray that includes ralph would do the same thing oops forget about that conversation with ralph it never happened we learned about that privilege stuff from uh the encyclopaedia britannica anyway we re sorry not only for making that mistake last week but also for losing the opportunity then and now to make fun of dumber stuff in the enron andersen accounting universe stuff like the shredding by the brilliantly named shredco the destitute family of ex ceo ken lay and the wacky isolated error that caused

inexperienced chili taster these are notes from an inexperienced chili taster named frank who was visiting texas from new jersey and fell into it recently i was lucky enough to be the th attendee at the state fair in texas and was asked to fill in to be a judge at a chili cook off apparently the original judge called in sick at the last moment and i happened to be standing there when the call came in i was assured by the other two judges native texans that it would be a fun event and a true taste of texas hospitality they assured me that the chili wouldn t be all that spicy and besides they told me i could have free beer during the tasting so i accepted here are the scorecards from the event chili mike s maniac mobster monster chili judge one a little too heavy on tomato amusing kick judge two nice smooth tomato flavor very mild frank holy shit what the hell is this stuff you could remove dried paint from your driveway with it took me two beers to put the flames out hope that s the worst one these texans are crazy chili arthur s afterburner chili judge one smoky with a hint of pork slight jalapeno tang judge two exciting bbq flavor needs more peppers to be taken seriously

starting to look hot just like this nuclear waste i m eating chili linda s legal lip remover judge one meaty strong chili cayenne peppers freshly ground adding considerable kick very impressive judge two chili using shredded beef could use more tomato must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement frank my ears are ringing and i can no longer focus my eyes i farted and four people behind me needed paramedics the contestant seemed offended when i told her that her chili had given me brain damage sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher it really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming screw those rednecks chili vera s very vegetarian variety judge one thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili good balance of spice and

wayne this my response to your question what is the regulatory analysis of peering arrangments peering is an act of establishing a relationship to pass internet traffic between one national internet backbone provider to another national provider peering is currently not subject to any industry specific regulations and is governed by commericial requirements the reason that peering is not regulated by federal communications commission or any other agency is mainly due to two factors data traffic has not been subjected to the same stringent regulation as voice traffic history of internet since it was the national science foundation nsf who founded the first backbone to encourage the exchange of information between different scientists and researchers the open environment for peering was essential to the rapid growth of the internet currently most of the internet traffic is exchanged through private pooling instead of the public network access point nap with private peering traffic can be exchanged in the same city which avoids the classic sydrome in which traffic that orignates and terminates in houston would have to travel through ny or even india please note that peering is not be be confused with interconnection in the pstn which are very cumbersome and expensive may i also ask for what reason are you bringing up the topic of peering is there a deal

unavoidably requires a local license held by local entity therefore trading of private line and lambda service terminating in japan must be done by a local entity exposure to high japanese tax and potential double tax reduced if japan only has half circuit but this requires having multiple ebs parties to a trade and trading half circuits may not even be a commercial alternative a master and a confirm must be bilateral i e there can be only be one counterparty on each side of the agreement thus a customer that wishes to trade an entire segment e g tokyo to san jose will have to execute two masters and two confirms if the half circuit alternative is used us tax guidelines to avoid double tax on japanese trading trading of australian bandwidth entails no license requirements trading of western european bandwidth entails no license requirements provided that no physical fiber is owned trading us telecom capacity requires an fcc license ebs inc has an fcc license no other affiliate of ebs inc needs to acquire an fcc license if that affiliate is directly or indirectly wholly owned by ebs inc with regard to any ip transport deal we must have the counterparty enter into a separate master agreement and confirm with each ebs entity involved in the transaction thus in an ip transport deal involving numerous countries that require licensed local entities to provide local ip services the counterparty will be required to execute a master with each of the local entities this is the only feasible way from a legal standpoint to structure an ip transport deal but is not a very good solution none of the foregoing points raise significant accounting issues other what are the important near term questions that remain to be answered and how long will it take to answer them does

original message from schmidt ann m sent thursday august am subject enron mentions gas liberalization turns volatile for german utility the wall street journal europe sides spend millions to generate support the washington post traders old utilities tangle over wires the washington post relentless search for growth humbles a mutual fund star the new york times from maine to n y way of atlanta trades light up states by long distance the washington post uk copper pushes ahead in subdued lme pre market reuters english news service papers on dabhol project not received the times of india india analysis poor governance hobbles india s reform drive reuters english news service politics economy european notebook gas liberalization turns volatile for german utility by philip shishkin staff reporter the wall street journal europe copyright c dow jones company inc two years ago the municipal utility in heidelberg germany decided to do something very unusual for european utilities it went shopping for natural gas for more than years the utility stadtwerke heidelberg didn t have a choice in suppliers as with other large industrial buyers of natural gas in europe it was locked into long term supply contracts in its case with ruhrgas ag and two other regional pipeline operators which own most of the natural gas pipelines in germany and are regulated by german authorities but in the european union moved to deregulate europe s natural gas market freeing factories utilities and other large industrial gas purchasers to forgo their traditional suppliers and look elsewhere the directive took effect in august so when stadtwerke heidelberg s latest contract expired it went shopping for gas one of the first german utilities to do so we wanted to show that it s possible to get gas from another supplier said peter erb the utility s manager of energy trading all the big players in the german market were saying it s not possible as for his traditional suppliers mr erb said they were very angry in the end stadtwerke heidelberg succeeded in finding an alternative supplier but the utility s troubles in the open market show just how difficult the process can be the utility and its new supplier enron corp of the u s had to negotiate with ruhrgas and the two other natural gas providers for six months before they could get access to transmission pipelines they also had to navigate through a confusing thicket of tariffs rules and technical requirements although the eu s gas directive required pipeline owners to provide non discriminatory access to their system it didn t make clear how that would be done as many would be gas suppliers quickly learned negotiating such access can be very tough the rules differ in different european nations and the pipeline owners can use the confusing regulations to their advantage to frustrate competitors so far there isn t the degree of competition that the industrial gas users expect from a liberalized market said francesco balocco energy issues manager at the european operations of dow chemical co energy consulting firm dri wefa recently surveyed large industrial gas buyers and found that while have sought new gas contracts only have switched suppliers the survey identified new entrants into the gas supply market including incumbent national players expanding in other eu countries and also large energy trading firms such as enron stadtwerke heidelberg started its effort to diversify its natural gas purchasing in december when it had just months remaining on its year contract mr erb picked up the phone and started calling potential suppliers and found the most interest at enron s german headquarters the houston texas based natural gas giant had grown explosively at home by competing for business against monopoly gas providers and it was looking to do the same abroad it took the two companies six months to secure access to pipelines in germany it s absolutely natural for a network operator that is also competing in the supply market to try to keep us off the network said paul hennemeyer enron s director of regulatory affairs enron s officials ran into constant delays were asked to supply more and more information and sometimes even had a hard time reaching the right people at the companies they were negotiating with mr hennemeyer said ruhrgas says it was trying to be helpful but argues that lengthy negotiations were inevitable because it was tackling many access issues for the first time we made every contribution to provide for fair and easy access network access said a ruhrgas spokeswoman in the beginning the system needed some time to develop shortly after a deal was reached the german government spelled out new rules on pipeline access which will make future negotiations easier in oct enron began to deliver gas to stadtwerke heidelberg and to another german municipal utility which followed a similar negotiating path stadtwerke heidelberg moved cautiously it bought of its natural gas from enron with the remainder from its traditional suppliers enron and stadtwerke heidelberg won t discuss the details of their contract though both say enron offered a cheaper price than stadtwerke heidelberg s other suppliers but the german utility quickly absorbed the cost saving lessons of a deregulated market starting in october the utility will drop enron in favor of another company wingas which has built a new pipeline to heidelberg the reason a combination of a better price and the convenience of a new supply route we obviously didn t break out the champagne enron s mr hennemeyer recalls but he says enron welcomes such switching of suppliers in general as a sign of the free market copyright dow jones company inc all rights reserved a section sides spend millions to generate support the washington post final a copyright the washington post co all rights reserved to hear executives at enron corp tell it their company has been outgunned for years by the giant utilities in the lobbying battles in washington over electricity policy we re a little guy said jeffrey k skilling who served as chief executive of the houston company until he quit last week we ve been fighting a battle against some very big hitters from to utilities spent large sums to keep electricity deregulation at bay helping to prevent congress from taking any action to mandate it at the local level and engineering a house restructuring bill generally viewed as favorable to utilities that bill died in the house commerce committee in a ferocious lobbying campaign was waged on retail deregulation said a former republican aide southern co the big atlanta based utility holding company made its influence felt he added in southern hired mississippian haley barbour to work for it in washington barbour left in to serve as chairman of the republican national committee a post he held until when he left the rnc southern again used his services after the gop took control of congress in the company also had direct access to house speaker newt gingrich r ga and senate majority leader trent lott r miss who looked out for the company s utilities in their home states reports filed last year with the federal energy regulatory commission provide other insights into the source of southern s strength in the south in its affiliates in mississippi alabama georgia and florida reported spending more than million on various civic political and related activities including for the birmingham early learning center for the mississippi power foundation and dozens of other gifts ranging from to the gulf coast symphony to for community charities in north florida but enron chairman kenneth lay was cultivating his own gop connections a longtime fundraiser and activist for former president george bush lay and enron officials had contributed more than to his son s presidential bid by july according to the center for public integrity lay according to a spokesman has also helped raise money for house majority whip tom delay r tex and for his republican majority issues committee which was set up in to support house gop members facing close races nonetheless southern co still outspent enron on lobbying in by million to million according to the center for responsive politics people talk about enron being big and powerful skilling said i mean come on the utilities were powerful adversaries we re still a little company compared to them dan morgan copyright dow jones company inc all rights reserved a section traders old utilities tangle over wires dan morgan washington post staff writer the washington post final a copyright the washington post co all rights reserved atlanta last of three articles ever since steamboat captain w p lay founded alabama power co in to develop electricity along the coosa river utility companies have been stringing wires throughout the south for one purpose so southerners could have power and light now a bunch of outsiders who buy and sell electricity but don t have a single retail customer below the mason dixon line have their sights set on those wires and they are getting a helping hand from some powerful allies in congress and the bush administration aided by supercomputers and operating out of trading rooms as big as hockey rinks the new breed of traders buy blocks of electricity anywhere along the nation s power grid then borrow transmission lines to ship it to the highest bidder but to more effectively move power from where it is cheap to where it is in strong demand they want to remove what they contend is a wire curtain around the south that means forcing the southeastern utilities to relinquish control of the wires to a new federally supervised regional authority the monopoly is the wires and that s where the battles occur said jeffrey k skilling who was chief executive of houston s enron corp the largest of the power merchants until he resigned last week the clash grows out of a huge federal gamble on electricity deregulation in with many utility behemoths staggering under debt from cost overruns on nuclear plants and the rapid spread of computer technology putting new demands on the grid congress opted for a competitive market the plan was to dismantle long standing utility monopolies and replace them with innovative electricity companies responsive to the laws of supply and demand now these new merchants of power along with restructured utilities that have shed their old ways and embraced the new competitive world have become strong advocates for a free flowing national electricity market but in a classic washington lobbying confrontation they are running into resistance from traditional utilities exemplified by atlanta s southern co now the parent of alabama power and other southern utilities at issue is how fast the federal government in the wake of the california electricity crisis should push for yet more changes last month the federal energy regulatory commission ferc recently stocked with president bush s pro market appointees ordered most utilities to negotiate with federal mediators on procedures for handing over control of their wires to a few big regional authorities those authorities in turn will build new transmission lines do away with bottlenecks set uniform rates and ensure equal access to all next month the senate will take up proposals to give ferc even more authority to restructure the electricity industry but what is good for enron may not necessarily be good for utility customers in the south according to executives at southern co whose affiliates dominate power sales in georgia alabama mississippi and north florida southern co chairman h allen franklin said in a recent interview will not go blindly into the system proposed by ferc although unfettered access to southern s miles of lines might help long distance sellers of wholesale power such as enron company officials say it could mean congestion power outages and higher prices for their million retail customers when california was restructured it was thought there would be massive savings franklin said well there haven t been building the power trade if the california energy crisis left doubts about the future of a competitive market in electricity a visit to houston dispels them in the city s energy alley enron corp with annual sales of more than billion last year double those of texaco is finishing a new floor office building adjacent to its story tower enron s competitors dynegy inc reliant energy and el paso energy are a few blocks away duke energy north american merchant arm of charlotte based duke power has settled in as well and calpine corp plans to take over floors of a new story building near enron these power merchants are at the center of a burgeoning unregulated wholesale market which now handles about a quarter of u s electricity output but it is still a work in progress fluid and accommodating in the northeast and parts of the midwest but much less open in the south in exchange for utilities opening up their transmission lines to the new wholesale market the energy policy act law allowed them to buy or build unregulated power plants outside their service areas many did quickest to embrace competition were california and the northeast which had long endured high power costs to spur competition california and some northeastern states went further requiring utilities to sell off their regulated plants and begin buying bulk power from wholesalers many states went further still ending their utilities long monopoly over retail sales and allowing customers to pick their own electricity provider the northeast already was something of a mecca for power traders because of its experiments with power pooling in which groups of utilities merge their separate transmission systems and use a central manager to market and distribute their electricity enron formed in by the merger of two big gas pipeline companies was quick to seize the opportunities its chairman kenneth lay a former official at the federal power commission ferc s precursor during the nixon administration had pioneered natural gas trading during the volatile period of pipeline deregulation in the s as the electricity market began to develop in the early s lay and skilling a weekend dirt biker with a degree from harvard business school began applying some of the lessons learned in the natural gas markets enron signed its first long term power contract in skilling recalls independent companies that wanted to install gas fired generators and sell the power on the grid could buy the gas from enron under long term contract then sell the electricity back to enron we started creating forward and futures markets using a lot more financial engineering than was required in other commodity businesses skilling said by the late s enron was buying the output of generating plants days weeks months and even years before it was produced using sophisticated weather and economic data to predict a price at which it could be profitably sold during the past five years enron has been one of the nation s fastest growing companies its net income rose percent in the second quarter of this year although the price of a share has sunk to less than half of its high of mainly because of setbacks in businesses unrelated to electricity investors pushed the price still lower after skilling s departure last week southern inhospitality like other merchants enron plunged into california after the legislature opened up that giant state to electricity competition but the southeast remained less friendly territory texas is the only southern state to adopt retail deregulation florida goes so far as to ban out of state companies from building almost any plant for the wholesale market the region is the domain of huge traditional utilities that control the wires from louisiana to florida and up into appalachia and the carolinas the web of power lines tied to the utilities coal nuclear and gas fired generating plants reaches across states via kilovolt workhorses and down into neighborhoods served via single wires strung on wooden poles for southern co its reputation as a traditional utility heavy is a badge of pride in it displayed a picture of a gorilla on its annual report clustered around its borders are entergy another huge holding company that serves louisiana arkansas and parts of mississippi and texas florida power light carolina power light duke power and the federal government s centralized power giant the tennessee valley authority those utilities have been under little pressure from customers to share the lines with wholesale competitors in the interest of lower prices prices run percent or more below the national average thanks to a rich lode of coal and natural gas and general public acceptance of the high tension lines that carry the power generated by those fuels ferc in a series of orders from to required utilities to open their wires for power shipments by independent merchants and to post how much transmission capacity they have available at any given time the message a former official said was they couldn t use the wires to preclude others from getting their juice to market but merchants say it is difficult to ascertain the accuracy of the postings made by the southeastern utilities because they operate the transmission lines as part of their closed plant to customer systems a november ferc staff investigation of bulk power markets in the southeast concluded that the transmission monopoly enjoyed by the region s utilities has discouraged independent power producers from siting new plants in the region ferc investigators cited southern co s refusal to let skygen energy inc connect to its transmission lines in alabama southern said the added load would cause an area wide stability problem for electric supply in that case ferc denied skygen s request for relief enron vice president kevin presto said that day ahead sales to customers such as municipal utilities in southern s territory have become possible but he said enron has trouble getting long term transmission commitments from southern that would enable it to sell such power regularly also he said enron cannot easily move power long distances through southern s grid if i tried to buy transmission across southern co to jacksonville electric there d be zero available presto said of the overall situation in the southeast he said that the utilities give you to percent of their transmission capability because they preserve the rest of it for native load retail customers so you have a huge highway that s supposed to promote the free sale of electrons that isn t available to the wholesalers southern co chairman franklin dismissed as unfounded the complaints of the merchants and officials representing alabama and georgia municipal utilities tied to southern co s lines say they generally have been treated well robert johnston president of the municipal electric authority of georgia meag which supplies power to towns took issue with the notion of a wire curtain the market is growing in georgia he said meag has its own trading room and has done business with a hundred or so traders or independent power producers it also has its own generators producing power at four sites though southern co has an interest in all of them there s not a grass roots interest driving the reforms franklin said it s the wholesale players while it squares off against the newcomers in the southeast though southern itself has aggressively exploited the growing wholesale market until it was spun off as a separate company earlier this year mirant corp southern co s marketing subsidiary competed in california the midwest and the north supplementing leaner profits from southern co s regulated units southern s strategy has been clear compete elsewhere and run a monopoly at home said allen mosher director of policy analysis at the american public power association well connected for battle the next move is up to the federal government next month sen jeff bingaman d n m chairman of the energy and natural resources committee plans to propose legislation giving ferc expanded powers over wholesale transactions and transmission so that vested interests will not be able to manipulate the use of the transmission system to benefit their own plants bingaman s office said in the house key players will be commerce committee chairman w j billy tauzin r la whose state is home to southern co s western neighbor entergy and rep joe barton r tex chairman of the energy and environment subcommittee who has had close ties to the huge coal dependent texas utility txu last week entergy hired former ferc chairman curt l hebert jr a mississippi prote acute ge acute of senate minority leader trent lott r miss to handle regulatory and government affairs enron recently hired a former aide to house majority leader richard k armey r tex as well as a former senior spokesman in the bush campaign edward gillespie of quinn gillespie associates enron officials are counting on support from house majority whip tom delay r tex the hometown houston congressman though it is uncertain how much influence delay an enthusiast for electricity deregulation can bring to bear industry lobbyists who gathered on capitol hill in july for closed door meetings that delay sponsored but did not attend could not reach consensus on electricity as a result the energy bill passed by the house on aug skirted key issues involving greater accessibility to the grid and electricity reliability bush s election and the fact that many utilities have plunged enthusiastically into the competitive market clearly has created a more favorable political climate for the power merchants bush s first two appointees to ferc pat wood iii and nora mead brownell moved quickly to fix what they viewed as the washington electricity bottleneck wood had worked with enron during a six year effort to create a more competitive energy market in texas where wood headed the state s public utility commission brownell a former pennsylvania utility regulator won praise from enron in when she helped block a restructuring plan that enron contended would keep it out of the philadelphia market on july with a majority in tow wood brownell and william l massey a clinton appointee who is an ardent supporter of competition tossed out proposals by southern co and other utilities and directed utilities throughout the country to commence negotiations with federal mediators on handing over control of their lines to four independent regional transmission organizations or rtos it was about time a bomb was dropped wood said but ferc s action may only have been what power association s mosher calls the beginning of a long movie among those opposing expanded ferc authority are environmentalists who are fearful that new federal powers could lead to an expansion of high voltage power lines western property rights advocates and state utility regulators politically well connected groups not now regulated by ferc including the tva rural electric co ops and municipal power systems are also wary of new federal powers there are big questions about ferc s role who will determine transmission line charges should there be federal authority to site power lines should there be ferc jurisdiction over power generation and reliability said rep richard burr r n c vice chairman of the house energy and commerce committee idaho utility regulator marsha smith who heads the electricity committee for the national association of regulatory utility commissioners noted that her state s three investor owned utilities cannot transfer ownership or control of their transmission lines without our approval such approval does not seem likely anytime soon smith noted that percent of the state s power comes from hydroelectric dams that s public property she said in alabama james sullivan a state utility regulator overseeing southern co s affiliate said he was not happy about the way ferc was proceeding i m opposed to any changes to our electric system in alabama until i know it s going to bring rates down and enhance reliability for us he said in the view of southern co chairman franklin it is still an open question whether ferc has the legal authority to force utilities to surrender control of all their wires nonetheless the restructuring of the power markets may already have gone too far to put the genie back in the bottle according to a former ferc official the power merchants readily concur everybody s paying too much because you ve got this huge conservatism built into this bureaucratic operation of the utilities enron s presto said staff researcher richard drezen contributed to this report copyright dow jones company inc all rights reserved business financial desk section a relentless search for growth humbles a mutual fund star by patrick mcgeehan the new york times page column c new york times company james d mccall was one of wall street s best stock pickers in the late s his hand so hot that merrill lynch eager to revive sales of its mutual funds paid a ransom to his previous employer to win his services starting early last year merrill s brokers collected more than billion from their clients for mr mccall to invest but in a breathtaking reversal of fortune mr mccall has compiled one of the worst investment records of the new century with that money all but about million has been lost leaving shares that cost many merrill customers more than each worth slightly more than as of tuesday mr mccall s main fund merrill lynch focus twenty held the rare distinction of ranking in the bottom percent among funds of its kind for the previous day week month quarter and year according to morningstar inc a company that analyzes mutual funds though mr mccall is free to invest anywhere in the stock market he has stuck to a growth seeking strategy that kept the fund invested primarily in technology stocks throughout that sector s long steep decline down almost percent in the last year the fund s performance has been significantly worse than that of the average technology fund let alone its peer group of more diversified funds it did however register aggressive gains in two market rallies lately the focus twenty fund seemingly went from bad to cursed as some of mr mccall s favorite stocks were laid even lower by a series of unfortunate surprises his bigger holdings include enron whose shares fell percent after its chief executive suddenly resigned and ciena which dropped percent in a day on disappointing earnings it has been a miserable week mr mccall allowed in an interview on tuesday it s not easy managing a portfolio like this in this type of an environment mr mccall s rapid rise and fall demonstrates how fleeting stock picking stardom can be said john c bogle founder of the vanguard group mutual fund company too often mr bogle said investors chase after the past returns of the fund manager of the moment only to find out they were pursuing a comet investors in vanguard s own aggressive growth fund vanguard growth equity have had their shares drop percent in value from their peak months ago still vanguard is known for its index funds the antithesis of mr mccall s stock picking discipline and mr bogle is indexing s most outspoken champion in speeches around the country he has repeatedly and coyly avoiding any mention of merrill s name cited the giant brokerage firm s creation of focus twenty and another fund in march as an example of racing to cash in on the latest market fad in roughly five weeks merrill s brokers gathered a total of more than billion for focus twenty and the internet strategies fund almost immediately those funds collapsed along with the internet and technology stocks they owned internet strategies which mr mccall does not manage never recovered and has now lost more than percent of its value merrill plans to merge it with another of its stock funds but mr mccall said his fund did not face a similar fate indeed he said robert doll the chief investment officer for merrill s funds recently told the firm s brokers that merrill was committed to focus twenty and its aggressive concentrated style mr doll was not available for comment but merrill confirmed mr mccall s account we are committed to having a full range of investment styles aggressive growth being one of them said a spokesman erik hendrickson funds seeking to rack up market beating returns by making big bets on as few as stocks proliferated in the late s in part because of mr mccall s success managing the pbhg large cap fund for pilgrim baxter a fund company in wayne pa in the two and a half years mr mccall ran it the pbhg fund ranked first among its peer group funds that buy stocks of large companies whose earnings are expected to grow quickly with average annual returns of more than percent it was those knockout numbers that brought merrill calling in its search for proven growth fund managers to broaden the firm s value oriented lineup of funds after mr mccall accepted merrill s job offer pilgrim baxter sued to stop him from breaking his employment contract mr mccall countersued and merrill later agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to settle the litigation in court papers pilgrim baxter disclosed that mr mccall had earned as much as million annually there mr mccall and merrill officials have repeatedly declined to reveal how much the firm paid pilgrim baxter or any details of mr mccall s compensation at merrill often however investment returns affect the pay of fund managers like focus twenty most of the concentrated funds sank last year with the collapse of technology stocks the managers of some of those funds including marsico focus have shifted money out of volatile technology and telecommunications stocks and into more mature companies like citigroup and omnicom which owns ad agencies mr mccall sniffed at some of those choices saying that the fund managers were not staying true to their mission of aggressive growth investing i m not going to own an omnicom he said or a sony or a viacom or general dynamics because they re growing in the single digits thomas marsico the manager of marsico focus and one of the original concentrated fund managers did not return a call seeking comment mr mccall said he would continue to try to identify the companies that have the best chance of increasing their profits at extraordinary rates regardless of what value other investors are assigning to those prospects at any given time valuation is not one of the factors that enters into our methodology mr mccall said about percent of focus twenty s assets are in technology stocks according to morningstar but the fund s biggest holding now is idec pharmaceuticals a drug maker kunal kapoor a morningstar analyst who tracks merrill s funds calls mr mccall a momentum investor who seeks growth at any price mr mccall may be the best investor of that stripe mr kapoor said but the strategy is so risky that he questions whether it was ever appropriate for so many of merrill customers i was really surprised by the amount of funds they were able to raise for a fund like that in such a short time mr kapoor said the question is do you really need a fund like this reading a prepared statement mr hendrickson said merrill lynch considered concentrated funds to be an appropriate option for some investors because they maximize the impact of professional stock picking over the long term and additionally may serve as an alternative to individual stock holdings he pointed out that merrill managed another concentrated fund merrill lynch focus value that had performed well this year gaining more than percent as for mr mccall s returns mr kapoor said he could not fault focus twenty because it had performed as would be expected for a fund of its composition it rang up some of the biggest gains of any fund in two brief periods when the market picked up the third quarter of and april of this year and some of the biggest losses when the market was down rather he said he was more disappointed with the other fund mr mccall manages the merrill lynch premier growth fund which is supposed to be less volatile because it holds about stocks that fund is down more than percent this year and has shrunk to less than million in assets mr mccall said that he had warned merrill s brokers all along just how volatile his returns could be and that focus twenty was no place for investors to put money they might need any time soon but he said he thinks that now more than ever is the time to take a chance on the fund with its shares selling for about i don t think a share is a lot to risk the indomitable fund manager said we could go down from here certainly but over the long term there is more potential on the upside than on the downside photo before james d mccall came to merrill lynch he was at pilgrim baxter where he successfully managed the pbhg large cap fund ethan hill pg c chart losing big since march clients of merrill lynch have poured more than billion into the main fund managed by james d mccall as many fund managers pulled their money out of technology stocks mr mccall stayed with the sector and compiled one of the worst investment records among fund managers the last months chart shows merrill lynch focus twenty fund since mar source

asking the mseb to furnish the financial documents relating to some contracts signed by enron for the project the mseb is learnt to be now examining the legality of making these documents public after a stern letter from the dabhol power company pointing out that the board might be liable for damages and legal action if the contractors take offence to making the documents public enron wrote to the mseb a few days after the order contending that most of these documents had confidentiality clauses which would make it actionable asked about this sources at dpc said that suppliers would be upset if their terms and conditions were made public since enron s is only one of the plants sourcing business from them for instance enron s lng fuel supply contract with an oman company has a confidentiality clause and would fear exposing its contract terms to the public in view of the fact that over per cent of its supply is concentrated in japan taiwan and korea it would be damaging for its business if

india s reform drive reuters english news service c reuters limited analysis poor governance hobbles india s reform drive by alan wheatley asian economics correspondent new delhi aug reuters after six months of political stalemate the rave reviews for finance minister yashwant sinha s reforming budget have given way to the despairing conclusion that perhaps india embraces change only in a crisis in which case a new wave of reforms might not be far away for unless growth picks up substantially from last year s percent pace policy experts said india would face a further deterioration in its public finances and rising unemployment that could put the world s largest democracy under serious strain we can t go on without further reforms for very long because we won t be able to grow even by five percent said shashanka bhide chief economist of the national council of applied economic research so the crisis is already there if we re not going to get six percent plus growth rates then it s a political problem there is a broad consensus on paper on the need for a second wave of reforms to build on ground breaking liberalisation measures rushed in after a balance of payments crisis in because its economy is fairly closed india has weathered the current global downturn much better than most of its asian neighbours who would be delighted with five percent growth still output has slowed for two years in a row as post reform momentum has petered out and crucially five percent growth falls far short of the percent average needed over the next decade to achieve prime minister atal behari vajpayee s goal of doubling per capita income currently around a year eight million people come into the workforce every year and a five percent growth rate would leave large numbers of people unemployed which means there will be greater social unrest said p chidambaram a former finance minister a five percent growth rate while statistically acceptable is simply politically unacceptable and socially unacceptable competitive politics it was to raise the economy s speed limit that sinha unveiled in his february budget a raft of far reaching structural reforms making it easier to fire workers and rolling back the policy of reserving certain industries for small and medium sized firms the reforms are high on the list of the many blueprints for change in india but they soon became mired in what the planning commission aptly calls the compulsion of competitive politics on a charitable view the slow progress is a reflection of the wondrous kaleidoscope that is india s multi party democracy this is not a country this is a vast continent in search of a synthesis in the political domain the social domain and the economic domain said amit mitra secretary general of the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry less charitably the legislative paralysis is due to the failure by an enfeebled vajpayee to crack heads in his unwieldy party coalition and force ministers to put the national interest before the myriad vested interests opposed to change arjun sengupta a professor at the centre for policy research said the absence of a unified agenda meant each member of the coalition was ploughing its own furrow resulting in policy inconsistency that was deterring badly needed investment this is the main problem we have today we do not have a coherent unified policy framework sengupta said he said the reform task facing the government was all the more difficult because india s most populous and backward states were falling farther and farther behind the better off ones if the centre cannot take care of the problems of disparity between the states we are facing major problems which can become explosive sengupta a former ambassador and imf official said peering through the gloom optimists point to the precedent of legislation passed without the pressure of a crisis in to open up india s insurance market to foreign firms they hope two equally controversial reform bills to liberalise the crisis ridden power sector and to make it easier to wind up bankrupt firms will also eventually become law after they won cabinet approval last week ending months of wrangling anybody who says reforms have been a failure in this country hasn t looked at figures on poverty very closely said planning commission member n k singh he said the poverty rate had fallen in the past decade to percent from percent reform priorities the list of reforms needed to sustain this improvement is lengthy because of its pivotal role in the economy the power sector is many experts number one priority the well catalogued troubles that foreign firms such as enron corp have encountered dealing with india s all but bankrupt state power boards have flashed warning signals to potential foreign investors domestic investors have also been deterred because industrial users pay twice as much as they would in china for electricity nevertheless attempts at serious reform have foundered on twin political rocks how to end overmanning at the power boards estimated at percent and how to charge users mainly farmers market rates for stolen or heavily subsidised power d k srivastava a professor at the national institute of public finance and policy said politicians might consider tough measures if they could be assured that benefits would be visible before they have to seek re election two or three years later any government under any minister will say to you how can i survive unless i can show my voters jobs srivastava said this is one of the basic constraints on power sector reform t k bhaumik a senior adviser at the confederation of indian industry agreed and said reformers were partly to blame for having failed to sell the case for change to india s mass poor we did not articulate the economic reform process to the people bhaumik said on privatisation for instance policy makers did not spell out the consequences for jobs i don t think we really understood the issues properly we simply followed the washington consensus and that didn t go down well with the people he said as divestment minister arun shourie knows only too well the privatisation programme he oversees a litmus test of india s reform will is stalled because of what shourie calls fractured politics and noise generated by corporate interests shourie said he could only hope that fading growth would jolt india s politicians into putting the country s interests first we re on the cusp at the moment on the question of reforms and i feel the real circumstances in which india is placed will force the political class to do the right thing he said copyright dow jones company inc all rights reserved,Data

"A data breach at Magellan Health, Inc. has put the personal information of Florida Blue members at risk, the company announced Friday.  Florida Blue says “less than 1 percent” of its approximately 5 million members were affected.  The breach, which reportedly occurred on May 28, was traced back to an employee who handles the healthcare provider’s member data. Magellan believes the employee’s email was hacked in a phishing scam. In doing so, numerous personal identifiers including the members’ names, dates of birth and prescriptions might’ve been accessed.The private information of nearly 44,000 TennCare members may have been stolen by a hacker who breached the email system of the agency’s pharmacy management vendor, officials announced on Friday.

"Honolulu-based Hawaii Pacific Health has fired an employee after discovering the employee had inappropriately accessed patient medical records.  The employee worked at Straub Medical Center. The health system found that the employee had wrongfully accessed patient records between November 2014 and January 2020. According to HHS’ Office for Civil Rights data breach portal, 3,772 patients may have been affected.  Hawaii Pacific Health does not believe the former employee was accessing the information for the purpose of identity theft. Rather, they believe the employee was acting out of curiosity. Nonetheless, Hawaii Pacific Health is offering the affected patients one year of free credit monitoring and identity restoration services.  Patient data that may have been exposed included names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, religion, race/ethnicity, Social Security numbers, medical record numbers, primary care providers, dates of services, appointment notes, hospital account numbers, department names, provider names, account numbers and health plan names.  Since the incident, Hawaii Pacific Health has reviewed its internal procedures and staff training. The health system is also looking to invest in different technologies. Hawaii Pacific Health has discovered an employee of Straub Medical Center in Honolulu has been snooping on the medical records of patients over a period of more than 5 years.  Hawaii Pacific Health discovered the unauthorized access on January 17, 2020 and launched an investigation. An analysis of access logs revealed the employee first started viewing patient records in November 2014 and continued to do so undetected until January 2020. During that time, the employee viewed the medical records of 3,772 patients. After concluding the investigation, the employee was terminated.  Affected patients had received treatment at Straub Medical Center, Kapiolani Medical Center for Women & Children, Pali Momi Medical Center, or Wilcox Medical Center. The types of information that the employee could have viewed included patients’ first and last names, telephone numbers, addresses, email addresses, dates of birth, race/ethnicity, religion, medical record numbers, primary care provider information, dates of service, appointment types and related notes, hospital account numbers, department name, provider names, guarantor names and account numbers, health plan names, and Social Security numbers.  The reason for accessing the records was not determined, but Hawaii Pacific Health believes it was out of curiosity rather than to obtain sensitive information for malicious purposes. However, data theft could not be ruled out. All patients whose records were accessed by the employee were notified by mail on March 17, 2020 and were offered one year of free credit monitoring and identity restoration services.  Hawaii Pacific Health is reviewing and updating its internal procedures and will be providing further training on patient privacy. The health system is also investigating new technologies that can be implemented to identify unauthorized medical record access and anomalous employee behavior access more rapidly.",Insider Misuse,Malware,0.4723712690217107,False

"As looted prescription drugs flood Baltimore streets, fueling a surge in violence, pharmacy chain Rite Aid warned customers Wednesday that their personal medical information could be on the streets, too.  Store officials said the labels on prescriptions stolen during the late April riots included patient names, addresses and the names of medication, but not other sensitive data such as Social Security numbers or credit card numbers.  The alert nonetheless raised concern among privacy advocates who said the information could be used for fraud. Rite Aid has hired a risk management firm to help protect customers from identity theft.  The risk also extends to customers at looted pharmacies across the city. The Drug Enforcement Administration is reviewing surveillance footage from 27 pharmacies to possibly file charges against looters, and a spokesman said the agency would help monitor for any reports of medical identity fraud.  Depending on what information pharmacies include on prescription labels, criminals could improperly refill the prescriptions, bill medical care to the prescription holder's insurance or combine the information with other stolen data to commit larger acts of fraud, experts said. Medical data is gaining in value on black markets, prompting hackers to increasingly target health care organizations, such as CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, the local insurer that last month revealed a data breach affecting more than 1 million customers.  ""It would not surprise me if patients who used those pharmacies that were looted later learned they were victims of medical identity fraud,"" said Ann Patterson, senior vice president and program director of the Medical Identity Fraud Alliance.  On Wednesday, Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts said police were working with federal partners such as the Drug Enforcement Administration to seize more than 175,000 ""units,"" or doses, of prescription drugs looted from 27 pharmacies and two methadone clinics when unrest erupted April 27, in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray from injuries sustained in police custody weeks earlier.  ""There's enough narcotics on the streets of Baltimore to keep it intoxicated for a year,"" Batts said. ""That amount of drugs has thrown off the balance on the streets of Baltimore.""  DEA Special Agent Gary Tuggle said even more drugs have been stolen than reported. About 40 percent of the looted pharmacies have not finished counting losses, he said.  There is no evidence that personal information found on stolen prescriptions has been used for fraud, pharmacy and law enforcement officials said.  Still, Rite Aid officials said the chain has hired the risk management firm Kroll as a precaution ""to alert impacted customers via a letter of notification and share with them the proactive measures it has taken to guard against identity theft.""  Federal law requires organizations bound by medical privacy laws, such as pharmacies, to disclose breaches of customer data. The organizations have 60 days to notify customers of such breaches, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.  Concerned Rite Aid customers can call Kroll at 1-855-294-2551 between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., or Rite Aid at 1-800-RITE-AID.  A spokeswoman for CVS Health said that chain also would be notifying patients whose personal information might have been compromised and would ""let them know of steps they should take to protect against the misuse of their personal information.""  Several CVS stores were looted, including one at Pennsylvania and North avenues that was set ablaze.  Peter Okojie, owner of two Care One pharmacies in Baltimore, said he had not heard any concerns over stolen information. Much of the drugs stolen from his pharmacies were later found on a school field, he said. Okojie said he was in communication with assisted-living facilities and other large customers about stolen drugs.  Even though prescription labels contain limited information, they still can be valuable to criminals, said Eva Velasquez, CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center. Having some personal information ""makes it a lot easier"" for criminals to commit fraud, allowing them to exploit data like prescription or insurance identification numbers, she said.  And that's not to mention general privacy concerns about medical conditions' being made public.  ""There's definitely a strong sense of violation any time people feel like their personal information is out there in someone's hands,"" Velasquez said.  Patterson recommended that customers of any of the looted pharmacies closely monitor any medical correspondence they receive, such as ""explanation of benefits"" documents that show what billings an insurer has received. She emphasized people should scrutinize claims made to their insurers under their names, a field that many often overlook because they don't suspect fraud, and watch for any letters from unfamiliar hospitals or other care providers.  ""As long as insurance pays for it, [people] don't really look at anything else,"" Patterson said.",Data Breach,Malware,0.5845748774204264,False
mf april th pdf good friday afternoon comments from the local guys one of the reasons that we the local guys are pretty exited about the recent rate cut by the federal reserves is that we think it will make a real difference over the last few months there has been considerable talk that while capital spending especially information technology spending has been budgeted by corporations for it has to a large extent been frozen as the economic uncertainty had taken a grip of corporate comptrollers we believe that this latest rate cut and possible future cuts could well spur greater corporate confidence as well as spur greater liquidity from the capital markets and thus free up already allocated budgets for corporate spending the year us t bond yield is the year yield is the year is

sides spent a lot of time pitching spinning and trying to persuade members of the greater heights area chamber of commerce which sponsored the event the debate started out in classic point counterpoint style with a panel of houston television news anchors asking the questions but both sides quickly went into attack mode in the pro arena corner were harris county houston sports authority chairman billy burge and don jordan the co chairman of let s build it together the pro arena campaign group opposing them were metropolitan coalition president dewayne lark and conservative activist bruce hotze les alexander gets all the benefits hotze said if this was a marriage it wouldn t last a week it is not a good deal burge retorted mr hotze you sound like bill clinton a half truth is the blackest lie of all after a few of hotze s anti arena comments received applause from the audience jordan chided some of those gathered you can be very confused and clap about the statements that are being made to you that aren t exactly accurate he said that is one of the benefits of being here today you can look beyond some of the advertising that has gone up percent of which is incorrect later the event got even more colorful after ktrk channel anchor bob boudreaux asked anti arena activists what they knew about the deal that fiscally conservative u s rep bill archer r houston didn t know archer is appearing in the pro arena campaigns most recent television commercials i think the pro arena campaign has been a clinton esque campaign of misstatements and misleading and i think they have told people that the rockets are going to pay their fair share hotze said they pay nothing up front i think if bill archer knew all the facts bill archer would not come out and endorse this jordan responded that s an incredible statement the only thing i know about that might be more incredible than what you just heard is if anybody out there believed it bill archer knows what s going on about this arena down here opponents accused pro arena forces of doling out corporate welfare at taxpayers expense while proponents repeatedly criticized arena opponents statements as misleading and inaccurate backers of the arena say it would spur downtown development strengthen the economy boost good feelings about the city and cement houston s position as a world class city lark said that he supports a new arena but that taxpayers shouldn t have to foot the bill especially when a billionaire sports team owner stands to benefit the most from the deal nov am houston chronicle briefs city and state azurix shareholder sues over deal s price a shareholder has sued azurix corp and its parent enron corp on grounds that a million plan to take azurix private undervalues the water company s shares azurix spokeswoman diane bazelides said the company has not been served with the papers and therefore is unable to comment on the lawsuit houston based enron last week offered to provide financing to let azurix purchase its shares at apiece enron owns a little more than a third of the water company it created two years ago and controls another third through an investor group called atlantic water trust in one of six lawsuits filed in delaware chancery court azurix shareholder thomas turberg says enron and azurix s directors have violated their duties to shareholders by agreeing to purchase the shares at a price that is less than the water company is worth the defendants are trying to use their control of azurix to force shareholders to sell their equity interest in azurix at an unfair price and deprive azurix s public shareholders of maximum value to which they are entitled the suit says turberg asks the judge to grant class action status to his case stop the transaction and award damages and legal fees enron shares rose to while azurix shares fell cents to azurix s shares have fallen more than percent since enron took the company public last year report on mutual

the year old fund returned per cent in per cent in and per cent last year over the years ended sept these strong numbers propelled it to a stellar compound average annual rate of return of per cent well above the per cent average of its global equity fund peers against a backdrop of rising inflation technology jitters and potential interest rate hikes however the fund has been struggling more recently year to date it has delivered barely a break even return despite this recent blip though fund analyst stephen kangas managing editor of toronto based fundlibrary com calls mammoth c i global a must have fund bill sterling s big picture strategy and co manager stephen waite s stock picking have worked to put this fund not only in the first quartile but right up there as a core offering within the global category mr kangas says mr sterling and his team most recently working for c i through independent credit suisse asset management llc now have a major stake in a new portfolio management partnership new york based c i global advisors llp that manages several funds in the toronto based c i family this new partnership means the management group is in place for the long haul says mr kangas who favours arrangements where managers have equity stakes driven by the big picture themes outlined in his appealing book boomernomics and using discounted cash flow as his primary yardstick mr sterling has created a growth oriented broadly diversified fund that seldom has much in common with its benchmark the morgan stanley world index it generally contains about stocks with the largest holding limited to roughly per cent of the portfolio and the top stocks representing no more than per cent of the pie you really can t do it any other way mr sterling says when it comes right down to it nobody really knows who s going to win all the battles with technology in particular you have to take a much broader view similarly although currency movements are always a factor in any global fund mr sterling makes little attempt to hedge his dollar exposure preferring to use it as another key criterion in determining his country choices we re much more likely to back an exporter who s going to benefit from a sliding currency than to try and play the currency itself that s really where you re going to benefit although still sporting a positive outlook for the long term mr sterling has been trying to reduce the risk in the portfolio in recent months despite the increased promise of an economic soft landing in north america he still worries that u s corporate profits may fail to meet expectations we ve been feeling a bit defensive for a while now as long as central banks are raising rates and we think one or two quarter point hikes in the u s are still likely you re going to see continued volatility and uncertainty particularly in u s technology stocks consequently he s reduced the fund s holdings in the united states and to a lesser extent in europe right now the fund has per cent of its stocks in the united states per cent in europe and per cent in japan with roughly per cent in cash that s a far cry from the beginning of the year when the fund had roughly two thirds of its money south of the border and very little cash on hand over the past months u s tech stocks have swung dramatically almost twice as much as the rest of the market as a result the securities of many technology companies are priced more like options than stocks mr sterling says and that means likely more volatility rather than less prudent asset allocation suggests that you diversify away from an asset class as its volatility increases despite the very real merits of the sector investors shouldn t have all their eggs in some high tech basket although technology still plays a significant role in the fund big holdings include pmc sierra inc broadcom inc vodafone airtouch plc and cisco systems inc mr sterling quickly points to what he calls the leopards within the fund s largest holdings companies such as corning inc are an increasing force in fibre optics and ones such as utility giant enron corp are changing their spots and looking for new ways to succeed but unlike many younger tech companies they still make money in the process he says for conservative investors looking to diversify their holdings the fund is definitely a core fund for most portfolios mr kangas says put this c i fund together with say a strong offering like agf international value and you ve got an excellent foundation to build upon lower risk strong returns

calif generators see ferc ruling as step not solution by christina cheddar dow jones news service copyright c dow jones company inc of dow jones newswires new york dow jones california s power generators think federal regulators took a big step toward improving what they see as a flawed market for wholesale electricity but may have stopped short of total solution earlier wednesday a committee formed by the u s federal energy regulatory commission released recommendations to revamp the golden state s power market the recommendations sprung from a probe conducted by the committee that sought to explain why california power prices tripled this past summer overall companies supplying power to the state applauded the committee s finding that market manipulation by power generators in the state wasn t to blame as some consumer groups had charged ferc is the third agency to agree that there was no price collusion in the market this summer said duke energy corp duk spokesman tom williams company officials also said they were pleased by the agency s recommendation that california should allow its three utilities to buy power from a variety of suppliers and buy power in the forward markets previously the utilities were required to buy and sell all power through the state s power exchange at market prices the previous requirement which bound the utilities to one supplier effectively created another monopoly said enron corp ene spokesman mark palmer utilities should be able to manage their own price risk palmer said williams cos wmb spokesman tim thuston agreed he said his company had been advocating this change and was pleased to see it included in the agency s recommendations however generators did raise concerns over a so called soft cap under the provision a supplier who sells power above a megawatt would be entitled to receive the bidding price however the supplier would have to file several reports to the ferc previously all bidders in a single price auction had to pay the highest bid paid which was otherwise known as the market clearing price under the committee s recommendation the market clearing price will never exceed the mw cap the companies also were concerned about a provision that could lead to refunds after october reliant energy inc rei spokesman john stout a two year refund window is a cloud hanging over the market during stout s initial review of the voluminous ferc report he said he wasn t able to determine exactly how the ferc would establish what is the right price for power he said reliant would be paying attention to this provision which he said could have broad implications for the companies who operate in the state other officials also noted that sometimes power is traded several times before it reaches its end users in those cases how would refunds be determined officials asked in sharing their initial reactions to the page report company officials agreed there is still much work to be done officials said they plan to make additional recommendations to the state s agencies in the days ahead the changes in the california power market are sure to affect the strategies of the state s power generators enron has already decided to back off plans to install megawatts of new generation in the state next spring said enron s palmer the generation was part of a project proposed by the california independent system operator enron and other companies are in negotiations to build the capacity which would have operated during periods of peak demand when prices are the highest palmer said the lingering uncertainty in the state s power market makes the project less financially attractive still other financial opportunities could be created by the proposed regulations palmer said enron s price risk management operations could get a boost because the state s utilities will now be free to purchase power in the forward markets other trading companies also see an opportunity there but none would estimate its potential value duke energy spokesman tom williams emphasized the charlotte n c company s commitment to california duke which supplies of california s power has already made a significant investment in the state he said duke expects to continue to spend money in the state for example duke will proceed with its plans to build its moss landing power plant in monterey county as for other power projects williams wouldn t provide specific details still many believe additional capacity is needed to meet the state s growing power needs and lower prices according to williams the ferc recommendations don t do enough to encourage new generation to be built in the state i think the next two months are full of uncertainty williams said he added as long as uncertainty persists in the market companies won t want to make the investment this point was echoed by other company officials as the companies continue to review the order and make recommendations it is likely officials will focus future debate on the soft cap and refund provisions of wednesday s proposals still the companies appeared encouraged that progress has been made toward correcting the state s markets and a lot is at stake according to reliant s stout not only is the company s future strategy in california riding on these decisions but states like nevada have slowed deregulation efforts in order to watch the events unfolding in california stout said stout said now is the time for consumer groups power suppliers utilities and the state agencies to come together to get this power market

dow jones news service copyright c dow jones company inc a dow jones newswires column new york dow jones sometimes it s easier to peddle a hard sell when you don t have everyone looking over your shoulder that s what appears to be the case with enron corp ene and what it s doing with its majority stake in azurix corp azx the water company enron partially spun off to the public two years ago in an unusual transaction enron has offered to loan azurix million so that it can buy back its stock from the public for a share that is any and all shares owned by everyone except for those controlled by enron following some fancy financial footwork involving trusts that own some of the azurix stock on its behalf the houston texas energy and commodity trading company appears to be priming azurix for a sale after failing to clinch a deal the more traditional way in a letter to azurix enron indicated that so far four potential buyers have presented themselves but the top suitor who offered a share seems to have had a change of heart after taking an in depth look at the company details of the latest scheme are scant all that is clear so far is that enron has hired lehman brothers as an adviser regarding its plans for azurix although enron declined to comment on its plans people familiar with the matter suggested that a complex transaction is now in the offing one option enron had was to do this in the more traditional manner buy back azurix shares itself but that posed a problem in doing so enron would have owned more than of the water company forcing it to consolidate all of azurix financials on its balance sheet including a healthy billion in debt instead with a little wave of a financial wand it appears enron has found a creative way around that problem here s how it works enron loans million to the management of azurix so it can repurchase the non enron related shares from the marketplace that leaves an entity called the atlantic water trust continuing to hold of azurix shares atlantic water is half owned by enron and another trust called marlin trust co enron has voting rights on marlin s shares a person familiar with the situation suggested that the transaction which has yet to be made public would include some form of sweetner to entice management to back an enron arranged sale of azurix to a third party instead of being a growth oriented play on deregulation and privatization in the water utility industry azurix will become a sort of quasi utility company said anatol feygin j p morgan s enron analyst once that is done enron will be able to cut overhead and development activity and look for a buyer an azurix spokeswoman said enron s offer is under consideration she declined to comment on enron s assertion that the water company had retained two advisers earlier this year to evaluate its strategic alternatives what s clear so far is that if enron succeeds in taking azurix private streamlining the decision making process by excluding private shareholders and the need to report to the securities and exchange commission it won t be able to sell the water business in parts and would likely look for a buyer for the whole lot that s because the equity of azurix s crown jewel u k s wessex water ltd is used to back a gbp million credit facility they can t sell wessex first because to do so they would have to take that facility out said john kennedy a utility analyst at standard poor s azurix acquired wessex in october for billion people familiar with the matter suggested that enron is now in the process of re evaluating wessex as well as smaller assets in latin america analysts said that wessex may now bring in about billion taking out long term debt that comes to about a share so why is enron so eager to get out of the water business trouble has been brewing for a while in september following months of azurix falling short of analysts earnings its high profile chief financial officer rebecca mark simultaneously resigned from her position and stepped down from enron s board the fact is that azurix has fallen short of enron s expectations the energy trading giant appears to have misjudged the speed of privatization in the water and waste water industry and now with projects behind revenues have been slow some billion in long term debt has accumulated and enron appears to have given up on its plans at the end enron s seconds may soon fuel ongoing utility consolidation in europe as least four large european water companies are believed to be potential buyers france s vivendi s generale

"A former nursing home office manager will serve nearly eight months in federal prison and pay restitution of more than $40,000 after stealing from four residents of two homes, one in Jacksonville.  The woman, Kristin Chaudoin, 34, of Decatur, pleaded guilty to embezzlement, use of an unauthorized access device and wire fraud on Aug. 5, 2015. She admitted stealing from residents of North Church Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Jacksonville and the Lincoln Rehabilitation Center in Decatur. She will pay $40,750.24 in restitution.  ""It's disturbing to see someone taking advantage of people they have been entrusted to care for,"" Illinois State Police Capt. Brian Ley said. ""Our hope is that our investigations, coupled with aggressive prosecution, will reduce the amount of fraud and embezzlement occurring against senior citizens in Illinois.""  The guilty plea stemmed from an eight-month investigation by Illinois State Police (ISP) Medicaid Fraud Control Bureau (MFCB) and the Social Security Administration's Office of Inspector General (SSA-OIG). ISP MFCB had received a complaint from the Illinois Department of Public Health on Dec. 4, 2013, concerning possible misappropriation of multiple residents' trust funds.  A U.S. District Judge in Springfield sentenced Chaudoin to federal prison on July 22, beginning later this month. Upon release from prison, she also must serve nearly eight months of home confinement and then will be on supervised release for three years.  Chaudoin was ordered to pay restitution of $36,313.79 to the Social Security Administration and $4,436.45 to Aperion Care, which has since taken over the two nursing homes.",Insider Misuse,Data Breach,0.5605859639456721,False
"A medical records coordinator at Cogent Healthcare in Hackensack stole the identities of multiple patients and used them to commit credit card fraud in late 2012, Bergen County prosecutors said Thursday. Latoyha S. Sapp, 37, of Wayne was being held on $35,000 bail in the Bergen County Jail after prosecutors charged her with trafficking in personal identifying information of another and computer-related theft.  Prosecutors arrested Sapp on Wednesday after learning that she allegedly acquired and distributed personal identifying information of multiple patients at Cogent Healthcare Incorporated, a company affiliated with Hackensack University Medical Center.  ""The patients' information was allegedly to be used to perpetrate credit card fraud in late 2012,"" Bergen County Prosecutor John L. Molinelli said. ""The information leading to the arrest of Ms. Sapp was obtained from a larger identity theft investigation that was conducted by members of the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office White Collar Crimes Squad in early 2013. That investigation led to the arrests of nine subjects in May 2013 for various identity theft and credit card fraud related crimes.""  Authorities did not say how many patients at Cogent Healthcare or Hackensack University Medical Center were compromised.  ""HackensackUMC is fully cooperating with law enforcement and working with Cogent to ensure this is handled swiftly and all impacted patients are notified immediately,"" Hackensack University Medical Center said in a statement. ""We are sorry this situation occurred and will do everything in our power to assist our patients through this process.

champagne after president bush unveiled his national energy strategy got a bad case of the hiccups when democrats regained control of the senate shares of companies that trade power climbed higher in the days following the release of the bush plan they ve been sliding since sen james jeffords of vermont defected from the republican party and wall street analysts say perceptions about the fate of the bush plan are definitely a factor the energy bill was so favorable it almost seemed like power companies got everything they would have asked for said barry abramson utility analyst at ubs warburg now it looks like everything is going to be more difficult to achieve but not impossible the bush plan seeks to give oil and gas drillers easier access to public lands to speed up the review process for refinery and power plant expansions and spur renewed interest in nuclear power shares of calpine corp dynegy inc and mirant corp climbed steadily from may to may the time between the release of the bush plan and reports of a senate shake up these stocks began to descend on may when sen jeffords plans were first reported and have continued downward with calpine losing percent dynegy slipping percent and mirant off nearly percent by the end of the day tuesday still analysts say investors may be overreacting despite the fanfare following the unveiling of president bush s energy plan we believed its chances of passage even with a republican majority was slim at best said daniel ford head of lehman brothers team of energy analysts with jeffords move the effort may be even more remote but the most likely outcome inaction has not changed ford acknowledged that talk of capping wholesale electricity prices for california has resurfaced in the senate though he dismissed the likelihood of this happening even with a democratic majority because bush still has veto power and to date has been steadfastly against caps democrats no doubt will emphasize conservation more than republicans would have but the momentum shift in the senate will not be overly dramatic according to bill breier vice president of the edison electric institute a washington based group that represents utilities there will still be fierce battles over efforts to relax power plant emissions a bush proposal that would benefit coal burners and proposals to expand the nation s electricity and natural gas infrastructure there s going to have to be consensus and we ve known that from the get go breier said analysts emphasized that it would be wrong to assume that much of the bush energy plan is now dead on arrival with democrats in control of the senate for instance attention has been given to the fact that sen jeff bingaman a democrat from new mexico will take over as chairman of the senate energy and natural resources committee replacing sen frank murkowski of alaska but bingaman supports legislation critical to the nuclear power industry including the price anderson act a law set to expire in that limits corporate liability from a nuclear accident other energy strategies favored by bush such as the deregulation of electricity markets and the construction of some new power plants over the next years will not be affected by the senate overhaul simply because their implementation is heavily dependent on state government not federal said ray niles who analyzes the power and natural gas

followed a lunchtime speech in which bush promised to support continuation of a ban on offshore oil drilling on the california coast and a crackdown on illegal price gouging by electricity suppliers but the speech and the meeting left clear that california would be on its own this summer when it comes to controlling expected price spikes since the president won t help davis said he has no choice but to sue he said the law is clear the federal energy regulatory commission must take action after its finding in the fall that prices are not just and reasonable this is not a question of whether you like price caps or you don t like price caps davis said we all have to enforce laws whether we like them or not coincidentally on tuesday the th u s circuit court of appeals tossed out a lawsuit brought by california lawmakers seeking a federal judicial order to lower prices the three judge panel in a brief statement said last week s appeal by state senate president john burton and state assembly speaker robert hertzberg does not warrant intervention of this court one legal expert said the significance of the decision is unclear in the lawsuit the legislature sought an emergency ruling but such decisions are tough to win said sean gallagher staff counsel for the public utilities commission the federal power act establishes a process for legal challenges that directs petitioners to first ask the ferc to reconsider a decision before going to federal court that is something the legislature did not do until tuesday the fact the th circuit has turned them down is by no means the end of the ballgame gallagher said davis said he would not make the same mistake he said he has already filed a complaint with the ferc and expects to give them about days to act before he files his lawsuit in the meantime the davis administration is considering cutting off state electricity purchases if the price goes too high this summer joseph fichera a gubernatorial adviser said monday that the idea is seriously under consideration but gerald parsky the president s california campaign chairman seemed to warn against such a plan when he said tuesday that businesses are more concerned about blackouts than about prices when asked he refused to say whether there should be a limit on the amount the state should pay for electricity the president s day began at camp pendleton

bush insisted he would not back down on his opposition to price caps we will not take any action that makes california s problems worse he said and that is why i oppose price caps price caps do nothing to reduce demand and they do nothing to increase supply the president promised to help by reducing electricity use at federal facilities enough to save megawatts of demand at peak hours that s roughly percent of peak summer demand and he promised to pursue complaints of illegal price gouging by electricity wholesalers i want to assure californians that the federal government takes very seriously our responsibility to make sure that companies are not illegally gouging consumers he said i publicly call on federal agencies to investigate all complaints of illegal gouging and if those

offered little to help with california s energy crisis while bush s aides said davis prescription would worsen the state s woes he just listened and said he is against price caps davis said for his part the president said in a midday speech to the world affairs council in century city my administration will continue to work to help california through the difficult months ahead the president s first full day in california consisted largely of appearances before friendly audiences the only discord came at the world affairs council luncheon where three hecklers disrupted his otherwise well received speech on energy and the economy and a few dozen protesters gathered outside the century city hotel davis toned down his harsh rhetoric of recent days praising bush for speeding up the process by which the federal government grants permits to new power plants the governor said bush agreed to begin looking into natural gas prices a step that davis praised natural gas which fuels virtually all new power plants being built in california and many of the old ones costs roughly three times more in california than in new york the big disagreement remains over the wholesale cost of electricity the state spent billion on electricity in the cost could skyrocket to billion this year we have an agreement to disagree but it is a big disagreement davis said the davis administration

reagan and to bush s father sent bush a letter opposing price caps countering another letter from economists delivered by davis supporting temporary steps to stabilize california s electricity market the president sounding defensive after coming under attack in a state in which he faces wide skepticism about his policies and his poll numbers are drooping said in an apparent slap at davis for too long too often too many have wasted energy pointing fingers and laying blame energy is a problem that requires action not politics not excuses but action blame shifting is not action it s a

division headquarters bush was cheered and greeted with several throaty chants of hoo aah from the approving leathernecks after the speech in los angeles he took part in a meeting on energy efficiency and then met with the governor at the end of the day he flew to fresno for a visit today to sequoia national park andrew h card jr bush s chief of staff said after the meeting with davis it was a very very friendly and constructive conversation davis described the session as cordial and businesslike card said that the two found areas in which they agreed to disagree but that there were more areas of agreement card also said bush told davis that he had asked pat wood a power utility official in texas whom he has named to the federal energy regulatory commission to visit with the governor to explore the state s energy problems the day had the feel of two intersecting political campaigns bush tried to show that he cared about california s woes davis surrounded himself with real californians including three young children the group was handpicked by the governor s aides to illustrate the effect of rising electricity bills i had hoped bush might have been able to hear the stories directly davis said before his private meeting with the president he sat on a couch on the th floor of the century plaza with three young children and listened to their parents and others discuss their worries about rising bills and fears about blackouts linking a thriving economy to a reliable affordable energy supply bush said all his work on energy would be guided by this test will any action increase supply at fair and reasonable prices will it decrease demand in equitable ways anything that meets that test will alleviate the shortage and we will move swiftly to adopt it price caps do nothing to reduce demand and they do nothing to increase supply he said adding that the clinton administration also opposed such restrictions he said they may sound appealing at first blush for those struggling to pay high energy bills but they would bring more serious shortages critics of price caps argue that they would make production of energy uneconomical and thus discourage exploration for new sources of oil and gas in a nod to concerns that energy companies are taking advantage of the shortages bush said the federal government takes very seriously our responsibility to make sure that companies are not illegally gouging consumers energy problems detailed to media to the surprise of no one in the davis administration bush did not adjust his schedule to listen to davis californians with energy problems so davis held a news conference where they could tell their stories then appeared with them in interviews with reporters from national television networks i m

reasonable wholesale electricity rates as a result the suit alleged the health and safety of californians were being threatened by frequent power outages in rejecting the suit the judges said the petitioners burton d san francisco hertzberg d sherman oaks and the city of oakland have not demonstrated that this case warrants the intervention of this court burton and hertzberg are conferring with their attorneys and have not decided whether to appeal the ruling to the u s supreme court although the democratic officeholders failed to persuade the court to force the hand of the federal regulators a parallel effort to accomplish the same goal is still moving forward the california assembly has directly petitioned the regulatory commission to reconsider an april order that called for limited price controls in the west during power emergencies this summer davis and other state leaders have blasted the order saying it is full of loopholes and will do little to stop what they consider blatant price gouging by electricity traders california still needs real relief not the smoke screen federal regulators have offered so far hertzberg said the bottom line is that the

reasonable and they are completely divorced from costs ferc has been ideologically fixated on the free market while ignoring the reality that a handful of energy suppliers most of them from texas are manipulating the market to make obscene profits at our expense during the last several months a flood of media exposes has revealed how the generators are turning power plants on and off as much as several times an hour to take advantage of price fluctuation taking plants offline for unscheduled maintenance and simply refusing to sell power to california state and federal investigators say these

controls in the immediate future and reliance on renewables in the years to come if bush continues his current course of action we can only conclude that he is more sympathetic to a handful of

estimates california paid billion for electricity in and may pay times that amount this year but mr bush refused repeating his view that caps will make california s problems worse in the long run by discouraging new investments in power plants for mr davis the issue is partly political he is up for re election next year and still has designs on the democratic presidential nomination but he hurt himself by moving too slowly to raise rates on consumers and businesses a move rightly urged by the administration to encourage conservation and he was unlucky enough to be governor at a time when the

involving the republican president and the democratic governor mr bush campaigned often here last year yet lost the state by percentage points or roughly million votes to al gore mr davis s own

recourse available to me to force the federal energy regulatory commission to order rebates to consumers or a lowering of prices but he expressed gratitude that mr bush had agreed to look into the question of why texas natural gas suppliers were charging for gas transported to california about three times what they were charging for gas transported to new york and to review whether to re impose tariffs suspended two years ago on such transmissions in comments that seemed to avoid brushing off california s problems mr bush promised slightly more federal money to help poor families pay their energy bills and he again pledged to speed federal reviews of plans to build generating plants at the camp pendleton marine base and then at a luncheon of the world affairs council here he said that this was a moment for solutions not blame shifting or politics we will not take any action that makes california s problems worse and that s why i oppose price caps mr bush told a largely sympathetic audience at the luncheon at the century plaza hotel delivering his most emphatic version of his longstanding position as the audience applauded mr davis sat impassively on the dais price caps do nothing to reduce demand and they do nothing to increase supply mr bush said this is not only my administration s position this was the position of the prior administration partly because mr bush had waited so long to visit the most populous state in the face of its severe energy problems his talk with mr davis took on the ballyhooed air of a superpower summit meeting with seconds for each man hovering in hotel ballrooms and hallways like rival campaign troops each side spinning for its man mr davis s aides did not expect to win much short term help but hoped at least to make the case that

like price caps now and stop the greedy generators at issue between mr davis and mr bush was the question of who should pay for the soaring energy prices here and the botched deregulation of the electricity market should it fall to the state s consumers the generators or the utilities to bolster his case and answer mr bush s economic critique mr davis released a letter today in which leading economists urge mr bush to find a middle ground between fixed price caps and a truly free electricity market we are mindful of the potential dangers of applying a simple price cap wrote the economists led by alfred kahn the architect of the deregulation of the country s airlines during the carter administration but california s electricity markets are not characterized by effective competition they continued urging that the regulatory commission establish cost of service prices that would create a just and reasonable rate standard assuming that a reasonable profit margin was established this form of flexible price controls would they contended assure that companies still had an incentive to sell power into the california market ferc s failure to act now will have dire consequences for the state of california and will set back potentially fatally the diffusion of competitive electricity markets across the country the letter said some of the high technology executives who met privately with mr bush and mr davis today also said they were interested in long term solutions and did not rank price caps among them craig barrett chief executive of intel corporation one of the state s largest employers and the maker of the chip that drives tens of millions of computers said that in the meeting with the president i didn t hear the word price caps mentioned he said they were kind of an artificial cap that is not going to solve the problem but mr barrett underscored the problem facing the state if it did not convince investors both foreign and domestic that enough power would soon

political adviser told reporters afterward that mr bush was committed to stopping any illegal price gouging by energy suppliers and bringing price relief by means other than price caps but mr davis in remarks to reporters called some form of price controls the thing that really matters above all else and said he and mr bush remained far apart he said the regulatory commission had already established that california s wholesale electricity market was dysfunctional mr davis also said he would file a lawsuit in federal court if the commission did not soon grant his request for a review of its earlier order to limit prices only during power emergencies and to revoke the authority of some generators to charge market based rates mr davis said he told the president you understand i have

bush credit for the strength of his constitution how many presidents would not only read the incessant and overheated criticisms from a state governor but fly all the way from washington to los angeles to endure them face to face not many we suspect yet president bush met with california gov gray davis tuesday where he heard the predictable complaints about his energy policy the governor wants federal price caps on wholesale energy costs beyond the limited caps now in place and the president understands and numerous historical examples show that caps lead to further shortages that s an honest difference of opinion but davis is trying to portray the bush administration s position in the worst possible light the governor keeps talking about evil texas power generators which have become the locus of blame for a governor who has remained frozen in the face of his first gubernatorial crisis the ambush nature of the visit anti bush protesters democratic press conferences highlighting the victims of price gouging is the handiwork of the two taxpayer funded gore campaign operatives hired by davis according to a washington times account like we said bush must have a strong constitution to walk into this sort of hostile situation still bush has the facts on his side when he argues against the quick fix of price caps caps reduce the incentive for producing electricity which depresses rather than increases supply a key reason for the current electricity imbalance is because of government imposed caps on the retail price utilities can charge users further distorting the market will only exacerbate the problem vice president dick cheney speaking on a national tv news show on tuesday called the davis rhetoric goofy the genesis of the electricity problem in california is too little supply caused largely by california s resistance to build new power plants and a flawed restructuring plan that distorted the market cheney noted correctly that at key points during the crisis the governor refused to act even some democrats concede that the governor could have kept the energy problem from becoming a crisis had he allowed slight rate increases and long term contracts back when utility executives began warning him of the looming power troubles there was even a time not so long ago that davis could have slowed his angry blame game rhetoric and gotten to work on the problem he could have engaged the new administration rather than heating up the rhetoric he could have looked for ways to increase power generation rather than threaten power generators on tuesday a davis spokesman deflected attention from the governor s falling poll numbers by pointing to bush s flagging numbers in the state both men aren t doing well in california but the issue should be a bigger concern to the governor of the state rather than to a president who won office without california support polls aren t what matter now in los angeles bush said energy

california gov gray davis got another stiff arm from president bush on tuesday this time in person once again the president refused to intervene in any near term plan to deal with the soaring price and decreasing reliability of energy here a double whammy that will help tilt the state into a recession later this year davis is undoubtedly right when he charges energy producers with an old fashioned practice called price gouging another way to say this is charging what the market will bear but that s not the way to stir up a public that seems to consider cheap plentiful power a fundamental human right bush is right that this problem needs a long term solution on the principle that the wrong kind of short term fix would only make things worse later on but that s just cover for his administration s misguided drill and burn energy policy neither of these political pros is telling the whole truth needless to say and barring intervention from a power higher than political expediency don t hold your breath waiting for that kind of honesty if bush wanted to tell the truth he might admit that his policy is tilted toward his political and financial supporters many of whom come from his home state of texas he d acknowledge that california s propensity for voting for democrats in statewide elections doesn t make him all that excited about bailing us out at the expense of the people who backed him bush may be correct to say that we can produce our way out of the current mess but a man who talks about the long term can t hide the fact that you can t produce affordable non renewable resources forever so an honest federal plan would emphasize conservation not brush it aside as the vice president and other administration officials have cavalierly done an honest plan would not pay mere lip service to renewable energy sources but davis is no slouch when it comes to denying reality either oh he admits that california s government albeit with the help and support of the energy companies enacted the bogus electricity deregulation plan but he would win more points if he also noted that the current system all but invites the producers to use what economists quaintly call market power to jack up prices so high he forgets that california and the nation lived in a fantasyland of unsustainably low energy prices during much of the s we persistently fail to learn anything from history namely that commodity prices even ones that are subject to rigging tend to fluctuate in extreme ways and when you re depending on non renewable energy sources the trend line will be up davis turns his administration s power purchases on behalf of the utilities into state secrets and insists that we trust him well we don t he hasn t earned it one of the most depressing moments in the recent battle over federal income tax rates came when bush told congress that the best way to help california s hard hit energy users was to cut taxes maybe we should just send those refund checks to texas where they apparently belong if davis had even an ounce of risk taking in his soul he d find a better way to deal with this situation than launching lawsuits making threats and stirring up resentment he s not much of an economist or forward thinker but he s a truly low class demagogue davis should thank bush and congress for the tax cut and then urge california to put it to the best possible use he should suggest we pool california taxpayers share of that money and embark on a crash program to curb energy consumption and develop renewable sources get the brightest minds in the technology and venture capital communities to join this crusade and put it on the ballot for voters to decide i m betting they d approve overwhelmingly let s face reality here the energy producers are going to take as much of our money as they can this president isn t about to stop it a governor with vision would be looking for a way to stick it to the producers not just in court but

most populous state a politically damaging self imposed exile that he will try to start repairing during a two day visit much has happened since then candidate bush boarded a plane at san jose international airport on halloween after a final campaign appearance in the state at a christian drug rehabilitation center in the city bush won the presidency but got walloped in california by former vice president al gore and an electricity crisis has engulfed the state helping make energy a national issue for the first time in decades and threatening the political future of gov gray davis those factors help explain why bush has gone four months into his presidency and will have visited other states before trekking to california in contrast bill clinton visited california his fifth week in office in as did gore the first of more than combined visits by the two during their eight years in the white house california is not nearly as important to bush politically as it was to clinton who needed the state for his re election but california has become the battleground for energy policy which is why he is finally coming this week after being urged to do so by many state republicans bush unveiled his national energy plan earlier this month citing california s electricity crisis as evidence the nation needs to embark on a massive increase in oil gas coal and even nuclear energy production davis has emerged as the democratic party s leading spokesman against the president s plan charging that the president is more interested in helping his friends in the energy industry than the people of california democrats have started running tv ads in the state criticizing bush s handling of the crisis and while bush appears in los angeles and fresno on tuesday house minority leader richard gephardt d mo and five bay area house democrats will hold a hearing on california s energy problems in oakland leon panetta the former monterey congress member who also served as clinton s chief of staff said bush had made a serious error in not paying closer attention to california s problems if i were chief of staff to the president i would strongly recommend they fire whoever is advising them on california because i think they ve made every mistake in the book panetta said he can try to do some repair work which i m sure this trip is all about but he s incurred some heavy damage the bush administration should have realized that even though he lost the state to gore by million votes california voters are independent minded and capable of shifting their allegiances panetta said in politics things can change and they do particularly in this state he said there s no question republicans have taken a big hit in the past few years but here you have a perfect opportunity you have a democratic governor probably in deep trouble because of this crisis and at the very moment when republicans could make some very important inroads into what they re doing to help this state they re walking away from it indeed a field poll released last week showed davis approval rating had plummeted to percent and that voters by a point margin were not inclined to support his re election bush has personally urged outgoing los angeles mayor richard riordan to challenge davis and the field poll showed him neck and neck with davis should he decide to run republicans would dearly love to retake control of the california governor s office but to do so bush must make the case that he is trying to help the state with its energy problems one of bush s top political advisers karen hughes dismissed the suggestion that the president had not been attentive to california saying he had been focused on the state s problems and touting his trip this week as taking place very early in his administration he made aggressive efforts to visit california throughout his campaign and he came up short in the vote on election day in california she said but he will not let that deter him from doing what is right for california dan schnur a republican consultant who was an aide to former gov pete wilson said bush s trip comes at a smart time strategically as davis has gone on the offensive to deflect blame for his own handling of the electricity crisis davis joined by other top democrats in the state and even some republican officials argues that the imposition of temporary caps on the price of wholesale electricity would contain soaring electricity prices until several new power plants under construction are online davis has started strongly criticizing bush for not pushing federal regulators to institute the price caps in the west bush believes that price caps will only make the situation worse by discouraging investment in new power plants white house aide hughes said bush plans to highlight one of his actions to help california tuesday he ll visit the camp pendleton marine corps base in southern california to tout the directive he gave to federal facilities to conserve energy during electricity emergencies in the state this summer bush also plans to meet with davis to discuss the electricity crisis the trip gives the president his first opportunity to make his case directly to the people of california schnur said you can have the best argument in the world but if you re making it from miles away it s awfully hard to close the sale the difficulty bush has had in getting out the message that he his trying to help california was evident in other field poll results last week which showed that percent of californians think bush is doing a poor or very poor job in trying to improve the state s energy situation in contrast davis receives a poor or very poor rating from percent of the people rep george radanovich r fresno said bush had taken a hit because he had not made his case directly to the state while davis has been hammering the white house for months radanovich was among the california republicans who personally urged bush and vice president cheney to visit the state he needs to come out and physically say he does care for the state and he s willing to tackle the problems for the state radanovich said of bush

we will not take any action that makes california s problems worse davis however argued that california s consumers are getting a raw deal without price limits he said he will sue the federal government to impose controls which he deems essential to fixing the state s energy problems emerging from a minute meeting with bush nearly twice as long as scheduled davis said the session was informational businesslike but we still have a fundamental disagreement over whether or not california is entitled to price relief i don t think it s a matter of philosophy or ideology it s a matter of law davis said federal agencies made a determination in november and again dec that the california market was dysfunctional prices were too high and we are entitled to some form of price relief the governor said davis warned that without price controls the state would spend billion on power which could send the economy spiraling down and affect the nation the meeting although described by both sides as cordial highlighted deep philosophical and political differences between bush and davis over the state s energy crunch those opposing views have been underscored by increasingly harsh

nothing to increase supply davis and other democrats including california sen dianne feinstein have for months urged bush to order price controls garry south davis senior political adviser charged yesterday that bush not the governor was playing politics with california s future the president must come to grips with the notion that adhering to rigid ideology in the face of an existing law which requires him to act is not just some kind of a face off with the governor of california south said it actually endangers the national economy greedy energy companies bush s speech which addressed trade the economy and tax issues as well as energy was interrupted by lengthy heckling from three protesters including former green party u s senate candidate medea benjamin the protesters yelling stop the greedy energy companies and price caps now were hustled out and one was arrested but the president to warm applause pressed on with his talk saying that the administration has taken specific steps to assist california including working with davis to speed the approval of new power plants expand electricity production and increase the flow of natural gas into the state bush also stressed conservation as an important part of the energy equation he said his proposed energy plan encourages renewable sources of energy including safe and clean nuclear power wind solar biomass and the president repeated his commitment to uphold the moratorium on offshore oil drilling in california bush also said he will take aggressive action to ensure that consumers are protected against price gougers the federal government takes very seriously our responsibility to make sure that companies are not illegally gouging consumers he said we will protect consumers against abuses in los angeles

post the washington post may wednesday final edition section editorial pg a length words headline california s power clash body president bush met california gov gray davis yesterday and the encounter did not go well mr davis emerged and headed straight for the microphones where he repeated his denunciations of the bush administration s attitude toward california s power crisis the governor s rhetoric which in the past has demonized texas energy companies is unappealing but the administration s stance is worse the bush davis argument centers around price caps for wholesale electricity mr davis points out that generators have been charging astronomical prices for power recently in the first three months of this year they pocketed more than five times the amount they were paid in the first quarter of moreover the recent price spikes reflect manipulation by suppliers who can drive the spot market skyward by withholding electricity when buyers are desperate for it mr davis rightly argues that this state of affairs justifies temporary price caps these might remain in effect for months or so by which time power plants currently being built would have started supplying electricity to california reducing the ability of the generators to manipulate the market the white house counters that it objects to price caps on principle since price suppression exacerbates shortages in nearly all cases this is true lower prices boost consumption and reduce supply leading to scarcity but the electricity market is different for one thing retail prices are set separately from wholesale ones so high wholesale prices do not stimulate conservation directly for another it takes around two years to build a power plant so high wholesale prices cannot stimulate increased supply in the short term if prices were capped at a level high enough to ensure a decent profit but lower than their recent level california s shortages would not worsen and its economic outlook would greatly improve it s even possible that shortages would grow milder because price caps might remove the incentive for generators to drive up prices by withholding supply the emptiness of the administration s rhetoric is demonstrated by the fact that even the federal energy regulatory commission which has shared the white house s tough stance toward california has proposed a complicated scheme to control california s wholesale prices the ferc s plan is weak for example it exempts energy marketing companies from its price controls thus allowing generators to get around the caps by selling power to the marketers who would then resell it at uncapped levels but at least the ferc has accepted the principle that some kind of federal market control is necessary the bush administration should resist the temptation to fall back on standard anti price control rhetoric mr davis for his part should soften his anti industry talk and accept the fact that part of the problem is for california to fix for a long time the governor resisted raising retail prices to stimulate conservation and even now he refuses to allow electricity costs to vary by the hour a measure that would save power at the times when it is most necessary unless both president and governor change their tune california s economy may tank possibly bringing the rest of the country down with it and the idea of power deregulation

federal government to force it to act in a meeting with davis bush offered to work with california to keep power flowing in the nation s largest state a departure from previous administration statements that california would largely be on its own to cope with price and supply problems this summer the president said however that while a federal cap on the wholesale price of electricity may sound appealing to those struggling to pay higher energy bills such controls would lead to more serious energy shortages and higher prices davis a democrat said afterward that he and the president had a fundamental difference on the question of whether the federal energy regulatory commission should order some form of price relief davis has said he wants the commission to place a cap on the wholesale price of electricity which bush contends would make california s situation worse by increasing demand but not supply we will file a lawsuit against the federal energy regulatory commission

administration is committed to doing our part to help california as it confronts its energy problems bush said in an address to the los angeles world affairs council all our efforts are guided by a simple test will any action increase supply at fair and reasonable prices will it decrease demand in equitable ways the viability of a suit by the state against the federal government over the price controls issue was cast somewhat in doubt today by a ruling by a federal appeals court in san francisco which turned down a request by state democratic lawmakers for a cap on the wholesale price of electricity the problems in california s power market which had its roots in a troubled effort by the legislature to deregulate electric utilities has imperiled the state s fiscal health driven utilities to the brink of bankruptcy and given rise to a widespread public pessimism here that pollsters have found to be the worst in years the governor brought charts and graphs to his meeting with bush to try to convince the president that the failure of the federal government to institute price caps could have ripple effects especially in the technology industry davis said california is headed toward spending billion more on power this year than it did two years ago it could well trigger a recession in california which could drag down the american economy into recession he said he told bush davis also released a letter from prominent economists including alfred kahn of cornell university the architect of airline deregulation arguing that its charter requires ferc to act to ensure that wholesale electricity prices are just and reasonable since the political future of davis who hopes to run for president in and bush could depend on how far california s power disruptions spread and

he does not have broad support but state republicans have been urging bush to pay more attention to california as they look ahead to the house elections of white house chief of staff andrew h card jr who sat in on the meeting said bush told davis that the administration wants the federal energy regulatory commission and other federal agencies to be diligent in making sure that there was no illegal

credit the state s energy crunch the plunging popularity of democratic gov gray davis and the growing approval of president bush with reviving republican hopes in california as recently as six months ago mr davis was considered nearly invulnerable for re election in he had trounced his republican opponent dan lungren for the governorship in with the democrats sweeping all but two statewide offices the secretary of state and the insurance commissioner but california s energy brownouts have given mr davis a black eye six months ago people would have said this guy is superman jim camp the california republican party political director told the washington times now people aren t impressed that he is blaming everyone else for the energy problem and has hired two former clinton political hit men at taxpayers expense to try to fix his political problem california secretary of state bill jones a republican agreed noting that mr davis approval rating is dropping very dramatically in the california field poll that and his lack of leadership and the images of the kind of people supporting him and opposing president bush are making it look good for republicans next year mr jones was referring to protesters from socialist organizations pro choice women the green party and the statewide democratic party who tried to storm the grounds of the marine corps base at camp pendleton where mr bush was speaking yesterday the prospect of voters seeing tv news coverage of such a coalition supporting mr davis delighted california republicans your average voters aren t going to be amused when they see these people aligning themselves with gray davis against president bush mr camp said basically they re ecoterrorists on the extreme left and with strong socialist ties the biggest mistake mr davis made so far some republicans think is in calling for price caps on wholesale electricity costs in the state and criticizing mr bush for supporting a free market solution to the state s energy shortage instead a legislated retail price ceiling on electricity was part of a deregulation bill that took the shackles off wholesale power prices causing the state s current rolling blackouts the th federal circuit court of appeals declined yesterday to order federal energy regulators to cap wholesale electricity prices a blow to mr davis whether republicans in california are up to explaining the basic economics involved and supporting mr bush s supply side solutions is another matter some party officials and consultants said privately meanwhile mr davis is taking the hit in opinion polls it isn t that people blame gray davis for the energy problem said mr jones the only declared candidate for the republican gubernatorial nomination they know the problem began before he was elected governor but it s a leadership question we had a crisis in california around this time last year and he wasn t decisive mr davis hired as communications consultants former al gore campaign

polite but unmistakable political posturing president bush and california gov gray davis failed to reach agreement tuesday on controls for energy prices in this state caught in a critical electricity shortage davis said he would move quickly to seek relief in federal court bush who lost california in the election made his first trip to the nation s most populous state since becoming president and left no doubt that he rejected democrat davis demands for caps on the price of energy mainly natural gas from the president s home state of texas price caps do nothing to reduce demand and they do nothing to increase supply bush said during a midday address to the los angeles world affairs council the president s comment brought enthusiastic applause from the audience of more than which included a large number of business people davis sat stone faced a few feet from the rostrum where the president spoke in an earlier appearance bush also denounced the posturing surrounding energy politics energy debates sometimes throw off some sparks he said but this is no time for harsh rhetoric it s certainly no time for name calling it s time for leadership and results it s time to put politics aside bush and davis had a minute meeting following the president s lunchtime address in los angeles afterward davis made clear he plans to pursue other approaches in his quest for price controls while the governor said he and the president had found areas of common ground he said there is a major gulf between the two on prices we still have a fundamental disagreement over whether or not california is entitled to price relief davis said after his meeting with the president i don t think it is matter of philosophy or ideology it is a matter of law state market dysfunctional the federal electric regulatory commission made a determination in november and again dec that the california market was dysfunctional prices were too high and the terms they used unjust and unreasonable and we are entitled as a matter of law to some form of price relief davis said the governor who has been mentioned as a potential democratic presidential contender in said he was ordering state officials to bring legal action against the regulatory panel to secure some kind of price relief either in the form of rebates or controls on the price california is charged for the natural gas it buys from suppliers in other states davis said suppliers were selling natural gas to new york for per million btu while charging california for the same amount of gas the governor repeatedly has charged that big energy suppliers many on them based in houston and other parts of texas were involved in price manipulation and gouging bush said tuesday that he would order federal agencies to thoroughly investigate any charges of gouging bush s speech was briefly interrupted three times as protesters demanded a reduction in energy prices stop the gouging of our economy one protester shouted another stood on a chair shouting as she held up a banner reading rate caps now earlier in a speech at camp pendleton u s marine base near san diego bush announced he would seek million more in aid to help low income people struggling with rising energy bills he already has asked congress for million for such assistance though bush s speech was billed as an energy conservation address he spent much of his time praising the military for its service and emphasizing the administration s support of the military including plans to raise pay and to improve health benefits and housing bush was more than halfway through his minute speech when he brought up the subject of energy conservation he began by praising camp pendleton and federal agencies for heeding his may order to take extra steps to conserve energy during peak hours bush said the department of defense committed itself to reducing its energy consumption by percent during peak hours i m pleased to report that the military and federal agencies are exceeding expectations he said bush said the conservation efforts have saved megawatts per hour during peak periods enough for the needs of people during peak demand periods that s as many people as live in pasadena calif bush said bush noted that a new car uses half as much gasoline as a car and a new refrigerator uses percent of the electricity needed for a model yet this conservation progress stalled in the s bush said vague on energy tactics the president also said his administration s energy plan includes recommendations of them aimed at revitalizing conservation efforts he did not specify any of his administration s conservation recommendations the president said energy secretary spencer abraham is working to secure the permits and easements necessary to clear a clogged section of the transmission grid between southern and northern california california s energy crisis has been caused by several factors most related to the flawed way in which the state deregulated the electricity industry in the mid s an element of that deregulation plan prohibited the state s major power corporations from passing on increases in their costs to consumers when the price of natural gas skyrocketed earlier this year companies were force to borrow huge sums to buy the power they needed to supply customers pacific gas and electric the state s largest utility was forced to seek federal bankruptcy protection the state s second largest supplier southern california edison teeters on the verge of insolvency california has spent billions of

libertarian party of california announced today while davis and bush go through the motions of an orchestrated meeting state taxpayers are being drained of billions of dollars with no end in sight charged libertarian state chairman aaron starr neither one seems willing to make the tough painful but necessary decisions that need to be made to end this crisis california has been spending an average of million per week since early february to buy power on behalf of the state s cash strapped utilities that is equal to roughly million per day per hour or for the minute meeting between the two leaders to date the state has spent billion in electricity after nearly billion california is nowhere closer to avoiding electricity shortages and blackouts this summer despite davis s rhetoric starr noted libertarians have been highly critical of davis s actions since january including making california a purchaser of power demanding price controls on wholesale electricity attempting a bailout of southern california edison by purchasing it s transmission lines threatening to seize power plants putting democratic consultants on the state payroll to the tune of per month blaming price gouging and market manipulation for california s problems the only gouging going on is of the taxpayer and the only manipulation is on davis s part in trying to shift the blame for this crisis said starr not that bush is entirely blameless libertarians are pleased that he has resisted price controls so far but there was no need for him to put forward an ineffective national energy plan we would rather see him propose repealing the federal power act of and abolishing the federal energy regulatory commission for starters starr suggested like modern day nero s davis and bush fiddled today while more taxpayer dollars burned sadly neither has demonstrated true leadership by explaining the crisis to the public honestly and lifting the existing electricity price controls which are the root cause

com image image april deal for sce s transmission assets appears dead on arrival by will mcnamara director electric industry analysis news item from reuters california gov gray davis billion dollar plan to save utility southern california edison sce from bankruptcy is in deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators legislative sources said the governor was having so much trouble gathering support for his plan that he could not find anyone to sponsor a bill one assembly official called the sce bailout plan the most unpopular piece of legislation in years analysis even when this deal was announced as an agreement in principle some days ago it seemed too far fetched to be possible the only party that clearly seems to benefit from the agreement forged between gov davis and sce is the cash strapped utility california energy customers appear to get the short end of an expensive stick while the state seemingly gains nothing of value beyond what could amount to a whole new set of administrative problems thus despite the hype with which gov davis announced this rescue plan for sce california legislators both republicans and democrats are saying not so fast and appear to be collectively opposed to the plan as it currently stands as it becomes apparent that the california legislature will not approve this plan the general consensus is that gov davis offer to sce is simply a financial bailout for the utility that provides no benefit to california residents for background on the details of gov davis rescue plan for sce please reference my issuealert from in a nutshell the state of california agreed to buy sce s mile transmission grid which covers much of the southern half of the state for billion times the system s book value sce would be allowed to use the proceeds to pay off its existing debt restoring it to financial stability both the california legislature and the cpuc need to approve this deal by aug or else the agreement is terminated in the highly politicized climate under which the california energy crisis has unfolded it is imperative to understand the agendas that each stakeholder possesses for instance keep in mind that gov davis political career has been severely damaged by the state s energy crisis and the fact that pacific gas electric co california s largest utility company declared bankruptcy has only further tainted the governor s standing perhaps more than any other goal davis wants to keep sce from also filing for chapter protection in addition davis believes he will be better able to solve the crisis if he assumes control over the state s transmission grid much like the state has assumed the role of a power purchasing agent normally a measure supported by the democratic governor could be easily approved by california s democrat controlled legislature however the energy issue has divided support for davis even within his own party consequently the governor needs the support of both republicans and democrats in order to see his rescue plan for sce pass for its part there was very little reason why sce should not have agreed to the governor s terms from multiple standpoints the utility gains enormously from the governor s offer while at the same time it avoids lengthy and costly bankruptcy proceedings under the agreement sce gains a method for pulling itself out of debt via rate increases that probably would be implemented over the next years further its parent company edison international gets to hold on to a reported billion that sce has provided to the corporate operation since the exception to this is a million tax refund that edison international would give back to sce while davis referred to his plan as a good balanced deal some consumer groups have charged that sce has taken the governor to the cleaners meanwhile california customers clearly lose in the deal because they would be forced to ultimately pay for the billion that the state needs to buy the transmission assets the state would purchase the lines with bonds that would be paid off by transmission fees charged to sce customers it is presently not clear whether or not those fees which are already part of monthly bills would be sufficient therefore it is likely that rates would be increased to support the purchase in addition the subtext of the deal is that customers would ultimately pay to drive down sce s debt which was accumulated as a result of unrestricted wholesale power costs charged by generators consequently california customers would bear the responsibility for prices that ferc has at times deemed unjust and unreasonable ultimately however it is the california legislature and cpuc that will have the authority to approve the agreement between gov davis and sce these two agencies must ultimately decide if the plan is good or bad and weigh the impact for various stakeholders presently the legislature in particular is finding that there are many questionable aspects about the plan for instance what value would there be in the california government owning only one portion of the state s interconnected transmission system pgocorp has walked away from the negotiating table and has expressed little interest in selling its transmission lines to the state no agreement with sempra energy parent of san diego gas electric has been reached either thus if the gov davis sce agreement is approved the state of california would gain ownership rights to only a portion of the overall transmission system in the state many legislators challenge the value of this especially when it is considered that most of the congestion that leads to higher prices within the state is concentrated along pg e s portion of the grid the counter argument to this point is that now that its utility is in bankruptcy proceedings pgomay not have the choice of whether or not to sell its transmission assets to the state the bankruptcy judge would make this decision thus some argue the state may have a better chance of obtaining pg e s transmission assets if it can first complete a deal with sce the second fundamental problem is that causing california legislators to turn their back on the governor s plan is what some have referred to as an obscene bailout for sce and its parent company some reportedly believe that gov davis rushed into an overly generous offer for sce out of anxiety caused by the breakdown in his communications with pg e as noted the billion offer for sce s assets is about times their book value so many legislators are having difficulty reconciling what appears to be an inappropriate price tag and once again a cost that taxpayers and ratepayers would ultimately have to absorb currently sce customers pay a ferc approved transmission rate based upon a cost plus formula if the state pays times book value it would equate to ratepayers paying two times over for those same transmission lines in addition some legislators including former democratic allies of gov davis have suggested that sce should be forced to enter bankruptcy as pacific gas electric co has done naturally legislators will approach the issue with their constituents in mind knowing that they will be accountable for how they vote on this plan looking at the issue from a customer perspective one could argue that sce declaring bankruptcy would create less financial hardship for california customers than bailing out the utility and increasing rates this will be a major political challenge for california legislators to resolve if the governor s plan becomes sponsored as a bill if i pull out my crystal ball and be so bold as to make projections in this case i would predict that there is little chance that gov davis rescue plan for sce will pass in its current form the energy crisis in california has become so politicized that legislators will be very reticent to approve any measure that resembles a financial bailout for one of the utilities especially without obtaining something of value for the state in return it is gov davis personal agenda to obtain control over the state s transmission assets but i don t see this as being a priority for other california lawmakers thus the deal will be a tough sell unless some new development occurs that puts owning sce s transmission assets in the state s best interest considering the many headaches associated with this business and the fact that the state has no expertise in this area i don t see this occurring consequently the game is by no means over for sce and its potential for bankruptcy does not appear to have decreased to any large extent one large california utility is already in bankruptcy court we could be only days or weeks away from seeing sce head in that direction as well an archive list of previous issuealerts

lawmakers moved to drop contempt charges against enron corp on thursday after the energy marketer agreed to begin turning over thousands of pages of documents immediately the last minute wrangling between enron and a special senate committee investigating energy price manipulation essentially brought to an end a series of extraordinary legislative proceedings that were last invoked in following hours of closed door meetings enron signed an agreement in the early evening allowing it to dodge an impending contempt finding by the full senate and the possibility of stiff fines under the deal enron will begin sharing records with the committee in exchange for a confidentiality agreement intended to protect its most sensitive documents after they are turned over it took too long to bring this to resolution said state sen joe dunn d santa ana who chairs the committee i can t help but think it had to do with the pending sanctions for contempt as part of the deal however enron did not agree to drop the lawsuit it filed in july asking the court to intervene on its behalf said spokeswoman karen denne she said the company is still considering its options we re pleased they ve agreed to withdraw the contempt charges denne said enron and two other companies that managed to quickly purge the charges against them had been found in contempt in late june after it refused to turn over

transactions in the state s wholesale electricity market enron officials balked at the request saying they didn t want to turn over documents that might include confidential trade secrets ultimately the refusal to turn over documents brought the company perilously close to being found in contempt by the senate thursday morning the senate rules committee met to consider the committee s contempt recommendation and whether it should be forwarded to the full senate along with suggested punishments in the form of fines after an hour of finger pointing and confusing allegations senate president pro tem john burton sent the two sides into a conference room to work out their differences at p m enron officials signed the same confidentiality agreement that several other companies have signed dunn said his committee will continue to meet throughout the fall and will inspect the documents that have been provided by energy companies in addition the committee awaits records from several municipal utilities including the sacramento municipal utility district smud was among municipal utilities that recently received subpoenas from the committee requesting documents the bee s emily bazar can be reached at or ebazar sacbee com mailto ebazar sacbee com enron and state reach agreement on papers the power company avoids a contempt order for files on electricity market september by kimberly kindy the orange county register sacramento enron corp signed a confidentiality agreement late thursday that should allow for the release of thousands of documents to aid in a senate investigation into the california electricity market the compromise apparently ends six months of stalled negotiations at stake for enron was a move to hold the company in contempt and start assessing millions of dollars in fines the senate rules committee on thursday morning had delayed for a day a vote to consider asking the full senate to hold enron in contempt because the company has not turned over the subpoenaed documents while delaying the decision senate leader john burton d san francisco ordered attorneys from the legislative counsel of california a senate committee investigating electricity price gouging and enron into a room to work out an agreement that would protect the security of confidential documents that contain trade secrets let s hope cooler minds prevail said rules committee member sen ross johnson r irvine as the committee members moved to a conference room for a daylong meeting the contempt proceedings for now have been dropped said sen joe dunn d santa ana who chairs the senate committee investigating price gouging and possible collusion in the electricity market enron officials did not return calls seeking comment on the agreement late thursday the state senate today is also expected to consider a resolution that would order the nation s two largest public employee pension funds to sell off stock of any company that is found in contempt by the legislature the legislative counsel of california is recommending the action it is not good public policy to hold stock in companies in contempt of the california legislature and therefore in contempt of the people of california said dunn who asked for the counsel s review and recommendation enron agrees to turn over documents to senate investigators by jennifer coleman associated press september sacramento enron corp agreed thursday to release company documents to a senate committee investigating possible price manipulation ending the committee s quest to cite the energy company for contempt for not complying with a subpoena the senate rules committee heard arguments from enron and the senate select committee to investigate price manipulation of the wholesale energy market over whether the energy company should be found in contempt in june the select committee subpoenaed enron files as part of its investigation into record high prices in the state s wholesale electricity market enron sued to quash the subpoena a motion a judge rejected the judge agreed however that enron was entitled to a protective order for documents revealing sensitive trading and financial information sen joe dunn d santa ana chairman of the select committee said late thursday that enron agreed to the same confidentiality agreement accepted by several other generators with that agreement dunn said the committee would withdraw a report that recommended enron be found in contempt he said he expects documents to be transferred immediately dunn had argued the subpoena also covered nonconfidential documents and since the energy company also refused to release those papers to the committee it was in contempt he asked sen john burton d san francisco chairman of the rules committee to approve fines against enron for each day they didn t comply with the subpoena the daily fines would start at doubling each day for days then the company would be fined million a day enron lawyer michael kirby said the company had put nonconfidential documents in a depository in sacramento so committee investigators could review them but dennis murphy a lawyer for the select committee said enron didn t tell investigators where the depository was located the committee discovered the address in documents filed by enron for the court case he said we ve been trying to get into the depository for a week they have not allowed our people in there to verify what documents are in there he said kirby disputed that and blamed the committee for delays in turning over the balance of the documents the two parties haven t met since the judge ordered the protective order and kirby said it was the committee that refused to work out the order s details dunn said the law requires enron to produce the documents before it was entitled to a protective order sen ross johnson r irvine said dunn s push to have enron found in contempt smacks at this point of enron being punished for exercising their right to go to court a contempt report on reliant energy has also been sent to the senate a contempt finding against mirant corp was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in sacramento for the committee s investigators if the full senate imposes sanctions against reliant or enron it will be the first time since when the senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee

"The wireless carrier said the stolen data includes the names, cell phone numbers, addresses, and birth dates of German subscribers.  Deutsche Telekom said it lost personal data for about 17 million T-Mobile Germany customers in the spring of 2006.  Thieves got their hands on a storage device with the data, which included the names, addresses, cell phone numbers, and some birth dates and e-mail addresses for high-profile German citizens. The company said the records did not contain bank details, credit card numbers, or call data.  T-Mobile Germany said it reported the data breach to prosecutors in 2006, and that there was no evidence that the data had been misused by unauthorized parties. But the issue came to light when German magazine Der Spiegel said it was recently able to access customer information through a third party.  ""We are very concerned by the fact that the incident from 2006 is relevant once again. Until now, we were under the assumption that the data in question had been recovered completely as part of the investigations of the public prosecutors' office and were safe,"" said Philipp Humm, managing director of T-Mobile Germany, in a statement. ""Notwithstanding the fact that the culprits have been at work with a tremendous criminal potential, we earnestly regret to say that we have not been able to protect our customer data in line with our standards.""  T-Mobile Germany said it has taken multiple steps to shore up its security since the breach, including tighter restrictions on who has access to information, more complex passwords, and increased monitoring of security systems. Subscribers are encouraged to call a toll-free hot line if they're concerned that their information has been compromised. ",Data Breach,Malware,0.7386336853558502,False

wed sources this article was originally published wednesday los angeles dow jones the california independent system operator paid about million wednesday for megawatts of power from powerex and still faced a massive deficit that threatened electricity reliability in the state high ranking market sources familiar with the iso s operation told dow jones newswires but the iso fell short of ordering rolling blackouts wednesday for the third consecutive day the iso wouldn t comment on the transactions saying it is sensitive market information but sources said powerex a subsidiary of british columbia hydro power authority x bch is the only energy company in the northwest region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the iso paid about a megawatt hour from the early afternoon through the evening but that still wasn t enough juice the los angeles department of water and power sold the iso megawatts of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of mwh the ladwp which is not governed by the iso needs megawatts of power to serve its customers it is free sell power instate above the mwh price cap the ladwp has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare the municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high however the ladwp is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging the suit claims the ladwp sells some of its power it gets from the federal bonneville power administration which sells hydropower at cheap rates back into the market at prices times higher powerex officials wouldn t comment on the iso power sale saying all transactions are proprietary but the company also sold the iso megawatts tuesday minutes before the iso was to declare rolling blackouts for a megawatt hour market sources said the iso whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state no matter what the cost started the day with a stage two power emergency which means its operating reserves fell to less than the iso is having to compete with investor owned utilities in the northwest that are willing to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps the iso warned federal regulators generators and utilities wednesday during a conference call that it would call a stage three power emergency wednesday but wouldn t order rolling blackouts a stage three is declared when the iso s operating reserves fall to less than and power is interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing but iso spokesman patrick dorinson said it would call a stage three only as a means of attracting additional electricity resources in order to line up more power we have to be in a dire situation dorinson said edison international unit eix southern california edison sempra energy unit sre san diego gas electric pg e corp pcg unit pacific gas electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of the high priced power socal edison and pg e are facing a debt of more than billion due to high wholesale electricity costs the utilities debt this week could grow by nearly billion analysts said it s still unclear whether retail customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity rates or if companies will absorb the costs by jason leopold dow jones newswires

chula vista calif wednesday morning a duke spokesman said the iso and puc have been inspecting all off line power plants in the state since tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the reasons generators say they are iso spokesman pat dorinson said about mw of power has been off the state s power grid since monday mw of which is off line for unplanned maintenance according to the iso the iso manages grid reliability as previously reported the iso told utilities and the federal energy regulatory commission wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert at pm pst gmt thursday meaning power reserves in the state would dip below and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid collapse however the iso said the action wouldn t result in rolling blackouts the iso and puc also inspected tuesday plants owned by dynegy inc dyn reliant energy inc rei and southern energy inc soe duke s mw moss landing plant was also inspected by puc representatives in june

and dynegy inc dyn said wednesday that representatives of california power officials had stopped by some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate reasons the california independent system operator which manages the state s power grid and one of its wholesale power markets and the california public utilities commission began on site inspections tuesday night of all power plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns iso spokesman pat dorinson said the state has had mw off the grid since monday mw for unplanned maintenance the iso wednesday called a stage power emergency for the third consecutive day meaning power reserves were below and customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be called on to do so as reported earlier reliant energy rei and southern energy inc soe said they had been visited by representatives of the iso and puc tuesday evening representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by aes and dynegy tuesday evening aes told the visitors they couldn t perform an unannounced full inspection of the company s megawatt huntington beach power station until wednesday morning when the plant s full staff would be present aes spokesman aaron thomas said thomas as well as an iso spokesman didn t know whether the representatives returned wednesday for a full inspection aes units down due to expired emissions credits the huntington beach facility and units at two other aes facilities have used up their nitrogen oxide or nox emission credits they were taken down two weeks ago in response to a request by the south coast air quality management district to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed thomas said aes has about mw or half its maximum output off line the entire huntington plant is off line as is mw worth of units at its alamitos and redondo beach plants the iso has asked aes to return its off line plants to operations but aes has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company million for polluting we d be happy to put our units back provided we don t get sued for it thomas said it s not clear to us that the iso trumps the air quality district s authority as reported a spokesman for the air quality district said tuesday that aes could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off line plants in case of power emergencies but choose not to do so dynegy s el segundo plant also visited by puc dynegy inc dyn said the puc visited its mw el segundo plant tuesday evening where two of the four units about mw worth were off line wednesday i guess our position is gee we re sorry you don t believe us but if you need to come and take a look for yourself that s fine said dynegy spokesman lynn lednicky lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps which could pose a safety hazard if not repaired we ve been doing all we can to get back in service lednicky said we even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited lednicky added that the puc seemed satisfied with

up on short term cold dow jones energy service dynegy confirms deal may be cut more than wsj dow jones news service copyright c dow jones company inc earlier tuesday a report in the wall street journal quoted people familiar with the matter who said enron and dynegy were in advanced discussions to cut the price of the all stock transaction by more than to about billion sousa the dynegy spokesman didn t comment on the newspaper report dynegy shares recently traded at up cents or while enron shares changed hands at down cents or under the original terms of the transaction enron shareholders are to receive of a dynegy share or for each share outstanding or about billion based on dynegy s recent stock price according to the journal report the new terms could be below of a dynegy share the deal is critical for enron which also simultaneously carrying out talks to receive between million to billion in additional funding to support its operations while carrying on negotiations to restructure its debt which totals about billion while dynegy has already provided enron with a cash infusion it is uncertain how long enron s current funds will allow it to remain solvent meanwhile a third employee lawsuit has been filed against enron over lost k retirement savings due to the recent collapse of enron s stock which has declined more than in the trailing months the suit claims enron locked down the plan which prevented employees from being able to sell the shares and seeks million for plan losses although the other recently filed employee suits didn t disclose the amount of compensation the plaintiffs are seeking it is possible the suits seek a similar level of damages a creditsights report said if this is true the creditsights report said it is

time an enron official wasn t immediately to comment enron fights to find near term sellers but still trading by mark golden of dow jones newswires dow jones energy service copyright c dow jones company inc new york dow jones enron corp ene continued to struggle tuesday to find willing sellers of near term gas and power in north america but the one time market maker was still able to trade on a limited basis according to market sources it s not getting any better said one major energy broker many energy trading companies aren t selling to enron and are only buying from it near term these include aquila inc ila mirant mir royal dutch shell group rd subsidiary coral energy sempra energy sre and morgan stanley dean witter s energy trading subsidiary said the broker the broker estimated enron s over the counter trading volume to be about of what it was a month ago companies are willing to buy from enron in the spot gas and power markets because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer some other companies like dynegy inc dyn duke energy corp duk and bp plc bp continue to trade with enron fairly freely the broker said dynegy has reached an agreement to acquire enron though the terms of that deal are being renegotiated the trading subsidiaries of troubled california utility holding companies pg e corp pcg and edison international eix also are trading with enron the third and largest group of companies are trading with enron on a very limited basis to reduce exposure by taking off setting trades against deals done long ago these include el paso corp epg reliant resources rri tractebel sa s b trb u s trading unit and regulated utilities the broker said several energy traders said that both power and gas were being sold at prices lower than enron was offering they ve been cut off from so many people said one electricity trader enron says just slight reduction in transactions an enron spokesman said he has seen a slight reduction in transactions but not to of the one month ago level the notional value of enron s day rolling average of transactions is billion said enron spokesman eric thode thode declined to give volume data for tuesday or monday although the company was giving daily information two weeks ago we re not doing daily information we re only speaking in terms of day rolling averages it s not fair to speak in terms of daily because of daily volatility thode said traders and brokers said they hope dynegy will offer some kind of guarantee to enron s trading to restore confidence but after enron s ability to transact took a severe turn for the worse nov dynegy said that the companies must continue to operate independently until their merger is approved and completed energy companies began shying away from enron over the past month as concerns about its finances precipitated a drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with junk rated debt but enron saw its ability to trade seriously damaged last week following the late release of its quarterly financial report with the u s securities exchange commission for the first time since enron s troubles began a month ago energy companies stopped selling to enron in the spot markets for fear that enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month based on the quarterly filing moody s investors service and standard poor s all rate enron one notch above speculative grade moody s has enron s ratings on review for a downgrade and s p has enron on negative

dance by james b stewart dow jones news service copyright c dow jones company inc of smartmoney com i know it s been hard but if you ve been able to divert yourself from the amazing news out of afghanistan this past week you may have noticed some important merger stories trouble in the compaq computer cpq hewlett packard hwp deal dynegy s dyn bid for enron ene and on monday the announcement of phillips petroleum s p proposed merger with conoco coc to create the world s sixth largest oil company the phillips conoco merger is an excellent example of what economists call horizontal integration the merger of two companies in the same business in this case oil and gas as an investor i love these combinations even though as a citizen i m often troubled by antitrust concerns investors who engage in what s called merger arbitrage or risk arbitrage which gained fame and notoriety in the s tend to sell stock in the acquiring company and buy the stock of the company being acquired though they re far less conspicuous now risk arbitrageurs play a prominent role in many hedge funds the strategy is appealing to many portfolio managers because returns are determined less by overall movement in the market than by the circumstances of particular deals successful risk arbitrage hedge funds typically earn to a year in good markets and bad individual investors can do some risk arbitrage of their own simply by buying stock in a company being acquired and hoping the deal goes through because of the risk that it won t either because of regulatory hurdles or market reaction these stocks usually trade at a discount to the acquisition price but few investors are willing to commit the time and resources to keep up with every twist in these deals let alone investing in enough of them to have a reasonably diversified portfolio i know i don t instead for long term investors i often recommend buying the stock of the acquiring company in this latest instance that would be phillips in similar circumstances i have had good luck buying exxon after it launched its bid for mobil to form exxon mobil xom and chevron after it acquired texaco to become chevrontexaco cvx their stocks were down on the news but later recovered handsomely as they began to benefit from cost cutting and economies of scale not to mention reduced competition even if the deal fails you aren t stuck owning a stock that was bid up only because a deal was announced honeywell hon investors will know only too well what i mean i still consider it outrageous that the european community blocked general electric s ge acquisition of honeywell but when the deal fell through ge investors were glad they had bought the acquiring company rather than the target so far the phillips conoco deal is unusual in that both stocks rose slightly after the merger was announced which suggests that other investors have caught on to the same phenomenon i ve noticed but even without a built in merger premium i m enthusiastic about the energy sector true oil stocks have dropped further since i last recommended them before the calamitous events of sept with talk of an out and out price war breaking out and dire predictions of a barrel oil it s no wonder but it s exactly when prospects in the oil patch look their worst that it s the time to buy these stocks if there is indeed a global economic recovery next year as seems ever more likely oil prices will rise so i recommend phillips both as a merger play and as a timely investment in the energy sector which brings me to enron i m glad i warned readers away from this former highflying natural gas pipeline and energy trading concern since its stock continued to fall precipitously until the takeover bid emerged from dynegy this isn t exactly a horizontal merger since dynegy isn t a big factor in energy trading but it will combine the two companies pipelines and natural gas holdings the market reaction to this deal was very unusual since shares of dynegy the acquiring company jumped on the news enron moved up just this is the opposite of what s supposed to happen but then nothing about enron has been typical the market seems to be saying that it likes the deal but doubts it will go through a prospect enhanced by the large breakup fee dynegy will enjoy if it s horrified by what it discovers in enron s still mysterious books personally i m sitting this one out but there may be an arbitrage opportunity in enron for risk tolerant investors if the deal goes through and i think it will enron shareholders will receive share of dynegy for each share of enron that s worth over a share at current prices yet enron closed tuesday at just down after a warning from the company that its falling credit ratings are starting to rattle its financial structure so while enron s position is becoming increasingly precarious this deal could make for a nice return and it s still potentially a very good bet for dynegy one that will add to its natural gas reserves and vault it into the front ranks of energy traders assuming it can hold on to enron s talented but now disgruntled employees finally there s the spectacle of the founding hewlett and packard families turning against h p s proposed acquisition of compaq on the grounds that proposed economies of scale read layoffs run counter to the spirit of the company s founders who treasured employee loyalty and apparently never fired anyone except for cause the dissidents acknowledged that they have little or no business and managerial experience themselves although they are represented on h p s board forgive me if i seem impatient with these beneficiaries of extravagant wealth and trust funds but this reasoning is absurd however much we might sympathize with their concern for employee well being the directors of a modern corporation must balance employees needs with those of other constituencies especially the shareholders otherwise a company will suffer far more dire consequences including bankruptcy or a forced sale in which far more people will lose their jobs than in any merger related layoffs i have already expressed my muted enthusiasm for the proposed h p compaq merger that the deal was even proposed is a sad commentary on how far the fortunes of these once great companies have fallen that said the merger still makes sense and it s far better for shareholders than if the companies are forced to continue in their respective downward spirals i owned both stocks until last week when i sold my small position in compaq i did this primarily to realize a tax loss more on tax loss selling next week but also because i wouldn t want to own it if the deal falls through i m holding on to my larger position in h p i think the deal will be completed despite the melodrama of family opposition eventually i believe both stocks will benefit and patient investors might want to buy one or both companies on any weakness reasons for thankfulness the stunning success of the northern alliance and the american military mission in afghanistan has been an amazing story this past week who will soon forget the accounts of newly liberated afghans digging up their tv sets casting off their veils and celebrating their freedom from taliban oppression the implications of this success are profound and in my view extremely positive economists are already scaling back their estimates for total cost of this war oil prices are plunging the effect is that of a significant tax cut and just when the economy needs it the capture of osama bin laden seems only a matter of time which means the world may soon be a safer place the promise of greater stability in the middle east has never seemed more tantalizing is it a paradox that as a calamitous nears an end i feel more thankful than i have in years filled with a far greater bounty of peace and prosperity perhaps not i hope this thanksgiving brings you hope joy and gratitude for the many blessings that have been bestowed upon us and that have survived and even flourished in the wake of tragedy for more information and analysis of companies and mutual funds

paper deal following the sharp fall in enron s share price of the past few weeks enron had hoped to finalise the deal and make an announcement yesterday that would calm investors the shares are trading at a small fraction of their record high last year of usd as of today however the revised deal still has not been formalised the current agreement with dynegy contains a material adverse change clause which could be invoked to call the deal off as part of its due diligence dynegy is examining details of enron s filing with the securities and exchange commission last week which reportedly contained information it had not received previously enron is a black hole and i don t know how deep the bottom is said fadel gheit an analyst at fahnestock co only four weeks ago enron s stock was trading at the usd mark gheit said noting that if the dynegy had done their homework the stock would not have continued to collapse the market sees this and somebody has to figure out the potential exposure it could be several billion dollars said gheit if the deal is to go through then the two companies must arrive at a new stock exchange ratio said gheit under the current acquisition agreement dynegy would exchange share for each enron share tendered according to the wall street journal the new ratio is expected to be less than share of dynegy stock for every share of enron stock

dow jones news service copyright c dow jones company inc a dow jones newswires column new york dow jones news that enron corp ene and would be suitor and savior dynegy inc dyn are working to renegotiate their merger agreement has done little to assuage market jitters about enron s fate and so far even professional arbitrageurs who normally thrive on placing bets on whether a merger is going to go through continue for the most part to stay clear of enron s stock and bonds because of the uncertainty surrounding the once mighty energy trader still reports that the equity swap ratio offered by dynegy could be revised down to below from has some hedge funds often willing to take more risks looking to place trades on the deal we re trying to figure out a good play said a trader at a new york hedge fund so far bets under consideration seem to be those that would include a combination of stock and debt trading somehow hedging a short position on enron s shares with a long position in some of its bonds people that are playing the debt are definitely playing the stock against it a hedge fund manager at another fund said this manager added we re still trying to evaluate different risk reward scenario on the debt and equity sides investors that sell stock short borrow shares in the hopes of replacing them later by purchasing them at a lower price arbitrageurs typically sell short shares of the acquirer while taking long positions in the stock of the target company but there is nothing typical about enron s financial woes and the rescue efforts launched by dynegy and large banks like j p morgan chase co and citigroup inc traders reported increased activity in the still mostly illiquid enron debt market some bids are coming in especially on the lower priced bonds said a trader at a large new york investment bank that makes a market in enron s bonds enron bonds which had fallen in value in recent weeks gained five to seven points early tuesday as investors continue to await confirmation from enron and dynegy that their merger deal remains on track albeit at a lower price enron s bonds due were recently trading at about cents on the dollar up from cents monday under the original terms of the deal enron holders would have gotten of dynegy shares for each of their enron shares quoting people close to the discussions the wall street journal reported tuesday that the new ratio is expected to be less than share of dynegy stock for every share of enron stock that lower exchange was also mentioned in a dow jones newswires story last friday at current prices a exchange ratio would value enron at less than a share essentially this new value if true means that it has now become easier for hedge funds and other risk takers to play the merger odds when a hedge fund shorting enron stock at a share risked losing more than if the merger went through at the ratio it now stands to lose only a share based on the value of enron stock under the new ratio at the same time it has become much easier to hedge that loss potential by going long on enron bonds if the merger doesn t happen enron is seen by many as heading for bankruptcy with an ultimate share value of that means that hedge funds shorting enron at stand to benefit by that amount hedge fund managers and traders said that current thinking puts the value of enron bonds at about cents on the dollar if the merger fails and about cents on the dollar if it goes through meanwhile the value of enron stock is capped at about a share if the merger goes through with a new conversion ratio of a lot of the guys are still very skeptical said a bond trader at a new york bank but this is really making the hedge trade easier and we ve seen more customers short the stock and buy the bonds still this type of bets isn t for the faint of heart and most investors are likely to wait for more news before taking a position we re nibbling a little bit at the bonds right now but the

the outcome dynegy is still in a good position for the long term he said his fund liquidated its enron holdings completely in mid to late october enron was the leader in energy trading and it s clearly suffering so dynegy is in a good shot to take up the mantle hilton pointed to enron s q filed last monday with the securities and exchange commission and the falling share price as potential triggers of the deal s material adverse affect clause those two things could very well make dynegy walk away from the merger if that happens hilton said an enron bankruptcy is a very real possibility

chairman kenneth lay is a personal friend of and top fundraiser for president george w bush and vice president dick cheney is in free fall the bailout by rival dynegy made public three weeks ago appears to be unraveling dynegy s buyout of enron was originally valued at billion but just as the deal was announced enron said its prior financial reporting was inaccurate and that it had overstated earnings by million over the past four years while the companies have not said the merger is off investors don t believe it will happen at least not at the stated price they have bid enron shares down to the point where the company has a market value of less than billion the shares closed yesterday at down from a year ago the situation is in flux as it has been for months during that time several top enron executives have been forced to resign jeffrey skilling enron s former chief executive officer left in august for personal reasons company officials said they hope to announce perhaps as early as today a series of changes a lower price for the takeover a cash infusion of million new extended loan terms by enron s bankers and somehow an agreement that prevents dynegy from walking away in the face of litigation over enron s devastated employee retirement plan lawsuits by shareholders are sure to follow considering enron s restatement and the pay it lavished on executives including lay who received million from salary bonus and the exercise of stock options in alone for now dynegy says it still wants to do a deal for its crosstown rival with revenue of billion even more alarming than the deterioration in the share price is the crisis of confidence in enron s reliability as a trading partner in worldwide energy markets last year enron was the dominant player in natural gas and electricity trading a fast paced complex business quite removed from the company s history as a gas and oil pipeline builder and operator the fear now is that other companies will refuse to trade with enron out of trepidation that it will file for bankruptcy and not pay its bills the company had billion in debt as of its last annual report and that number has likely grown by already credit agencies have cut their ratings on enron debt dynegy and its partner chevrontexaco may pump billions of dollars into enron s operations if the purchase goes through but the deal will certainly undergo regulatory scrutiny and will take months to close investors and energy traders are increasingly doubtful that enron can hang on by itself enron bills itself as one of the world s leading energy commodities and services companies it says it markets electricity and natural gas delivers energy and other physical commodities and provides financial and risk management services to customers around the world while all this may be true its popularity with investors was based largely on its fast growing revenue much like the internet companies whose collapse it mirrors few shareholders had any understanding of what enron did to generate that revenue and indeed enron s own auditors at arthur andersen were confused most of the revenue was generated from trading but the company s shares sold as if it was still an industrial company and not a financial firm enron was famous for being famous before the start of the baseball season it purchased the rights to have its name on houston s new ballpark by enron field may need a new name the name enron itself sounds like it has something to do with energy but it means nothing at the time the company was formed from the merger of internorth of omaha and houston natural gas the idea was to call the company enteron but the namers then looked in the dictionary and found out that enteron means intestines they decided to drop the te in the middle and go with enron soon enron may be part of dynegy a much smaller company in terms of revenue if the deal falls apart it may want to go back to enteron merger traders wary even if enron dynegy cut new terms by christina cheddar dow jones news service copyright c dow jones company inc new york dow jones even if dynegy inc dyn revises the terms of its acquisition of enron corp ene some takeover traders say the stock remains too risky earlier tuesday a dynegy spokesman confirmed the company was in talks to restructure the enron acquisition separately a person familiar with the negotiations said the talks are centered on creating a package that includes a lower exchange ratio for enron shareholders a provision for additional funding for enron and the refinancing of enron s existing debt even with the boost enron shares have received from the reports they continue to trade at a sharp discount to the original deal s value enron shares recently traded at up cents or while dynegy shares changed hands at up or under the original terms of the deal enron shareholders will receive of a dynegy for each share outstanding or billion at current trading levels enron shares are at a discount to the offer price according to the wall street journal dynegy and enron are contemplating an exchange ratio of less than of a dynegy share or about billion the rejiggered deal is an attempt to restore confidence in enron s ability to carry on its core energy marketing and trading business as the deal moves toward completion the person said as the market waits for more details from the two companies some say it will take more than a revised offer to provide takeover traders also known as arbitrageurs with enough confidence to play the deal in the typical fashion often arbitrageurs bet on pending mergers by selling short shares of the acquiring company and buying shares of the target in this way the traders hope to profit as the target s share price moves toward the buyer s offer but according to some traders there is too much risk even for those accustomed to uncertainty to play the dynegy enron deal in this way several traders said they were still wary that the deal could collapse and potentially push enron into bankruptcy enron s fortunes took a sharp turn for the worst after investors began to realize the company liberally used accounting loopholes to move its debts into off balance sheet financing vehicles including partnerships run by its former chief financial officer andrew fastow there s nothing like accounting to scare people said one trader who

for energy by pg e customers in northern california was almost the same as at the same time wednesday iso officials said protesters didn t expect significant changes on the grid i feel it will at least send a message that we don t have to depend on it energy said jackie bell a consultant at the capitol joining the conservation drive from her apartment on fulton avenue it s just a symbolic act said peter lopez of sacramento who decided to use the evening to meditate maybe i ll just go outside stare at the stars and try to spot a few constellations in the night it was the longest day of the year and one of the hottest but those determined to advocate conservation didn t mind the sacrifice people are getting focused on the fact that we have power at our end said joan blades a spokeswoman for moveon a grass roots organization in the bay area and one of hundreds of online groups passing along the call for the voluntary blackout an electrical engineer in oakland started the roll your own blackout idea when he posted a note in a political chat room in april then an artist in los angeles forwarded the e mail to a number of friends and from there it quickly spanned the globe by thursday afternoon more than people had signed up at the moveon web site to join the protest blades said many threw blackout parties in san francisco the nonprofit group global exchange gathered hundreds around a big bonfire at ocean beach at his home in east sacramento lynch did fine without electricity for three hours he ate tuna salad for dinner watered the lawn and when it got dark he opened the windows and let some air in we should show that people are willing to shut the power off if the prices go too high he said iso has not declared a power emergency since may we have seen a consistent conservation on a day to day basis and it s making the difference between blackouts and no blackouts iso spokeswoman stephanie mccorkle said mccorkle encouraged initiatives like roll your own blackout people are conserving she said and we can only support this whole effort the bee s silvina mart nez can be reached at or smartinez sacbee com davis consultants had contract with edison the disclosures turn up the heat on the governor for hiring the ex clinton aides by emily bazar bee capitol bureau published june two consultants hired to advise gov gray davis on energy policy officially disclosed their contract with southern california edison on thursday but davis aides insisted it is not a conflict because edison and the governor s office have the same goal communications consultants chris lehane and mark fabiani have drawn intense criticism since they were hired last month to shape the democratic governor s public response to the state energy crisis the former clinton administration communication aides nicknamed the masters of disaster for their spin on the whitewater travel office and fund raising controversies at the clinton white house have come under fire for receiving a six month a month contract more than the governor or anyone on his staff makes secretary of state bill jones a republican who is running for governor next year has called for an investigation into potential conflicts state controller kathleen connell a democrat has said she will not issue paychecks to the pair pending her own investigation the criticism mounted after the duo s economic interest disclosure forms were released late thursday showing that each has received at least under contract from edison in the past year but davis spokeswoman hilary mclean defended their credibility saying there s no conflict of interest because lehane and fabiani both disclosed that they had worked for edison before they signed their contracts with the state besides she added edison and the governor are working toward the same goal both want the legislature to adopt a memorandum of understanding a proposed agreement that would prevent edison from going bankrupt by financing a state purchase of the utility s transmission lines it s not a conflict because there s been full disclosure mclean said edison and the governor s office have the same goal passing the mou we re working together at this point with edison but open government groups and republican lawmakers bristled at the notion that disclosure negates any potential conflict derek cressman of the california public interest research group pointed to a section of state law that prohibits public officials from influencing decisions if it would have a material financial effect on a business entity that provided them or more within the last year you have two individuals on the government payroll who had previously been on the edison payroll and it s not clear to whom their loyalties are he said just because they ve revealed it doesn t mean there s not a conflict there and that they re not serving two masters on thursday jones said he is awaiting the results of the fair political practices commission investigation and agrees with connell s decision this week to withhold payment from the consultants this further calls into question the ethics of how these individuals were hired and contracts were let jones said senate republican leader jim brulte believes there s no question that lehane and fabiani are violating conflict of interest laws and suggested that the two should be paid out of davis campaign funds which had reached million by jan brulte of rancho cucamonga added that he would not vote for a state budget as long as lehane and fabiani remain on the state payroll the state of california does not need to be paying political wordsmiths a month he said i just wish davis were as frugal with the taxpayers money as he is with his campaign money the bee s emily bazar can be reached at or ebazar sacbee com state deal may ease blackout threat canada to supply energy as summer demand rises by ed mendel union tribune staff writer june sacramento california may be able to avoid some of the blackouts predicted for this summer thanks to a little known power swapping agreement with a canadian utility the arrangement is expected to give california electricity in july and august from the hydroelectric generators of bc hydro in british columbia despite a serious drought in the northwest california has sold surplus power in recent months to the government owned utility which is expected to return power to the state as heat drives up the demand for electricity state deal may ease blackout threat continuing coverage california s power crisis despite the energy crunch the state often finds itself with surplus power that can be sold or swapped for instance advance power purchases that provide energy at a better price may deliver more power than needed at any given time particularly during off peak hours bc hydro s reservoirs and hydroelectric generators are a little like an electricity storage battery by importing california power bc hydro has been able to conserve water that can be released this summer to produce power for california as a result of the agreement and other factors state power buyers say they are in a stronger position going into the hot summer months than they had expected so far this week the state has managed to get through a heat wave without so much as a stage power alert we are in much better shape at this point than i imagined we would have been as little as a month ago said ray hart head of the power purchasing unit in the state department of water resources the north american electric reliability council which last month predicted hours of rolling blackouts for california this summer has noticed a change in recent weeks we don t seem to have the crisis we were all expecting said ellen vancko a council spokeswoman but whether that is a short term or a long term event we don t think anyone knows yet much of the credit for avoiding blackouts is given to unexpectedly high conservation by californians and an increased supply of power many generators that had been shut down for maintenance or lack of payment are now back on line but the hydroelectric power agreement had gone unnoticed until now hart mentioned it during a senate energy committee hearing this week but he declined to reveal the amount of power banked with bc hydro saying it could hurt the state s competitive position in the market if i start talking specifics said hart then i have to give out what i am doing every single day and i have no market position in the past california routinely sent power to a number of utilities in the pacific northwest during the winter when residents there needed heat northwest utilities returned power to california in the summer when air conditioning drove up demand little was expected from the reciprocal arrangement this year because california was short of power last winter as electricity prices soared and drought has sharply lowered reservoirs in the northwest but the agreement with bc hydro will provide at least some power this summer the state was forced to begin buying power in january after its two largest utilities southern california edison and pacific gas and electric were unable to borrow because of a billion debt the rates that the utilities could charge their customers were frozen under a failed deregulation plan as the cost of power on the wholesale market skyrocketed hart said it took time to convince bc hydro which has demanded cash for some electricity that it could safely do business with california despite big debts owed to generators for power they supplied to the utilities we have only been able to do it for the last couple of months said hart it took a long time to get them to do it because of credit issues a spokesman for bc hydro said the utility engages in power swaps but does not release the name of the other parties or the terms of the agreements our first priority is taking care of our own said warren cousins of bc hydro we are still looking for opportunities to help out other entities when we can hart said the state has another arrangement with the federal bonneville power authority but again refused to provide details he said the state has sold surplus power to several buyers including the los angeles department of water and power information about state power purchases had been closely guarded until recently gov gray davis pressured by lawsuits and a court ruling released edited versions last week of long term power contracts worth billion the davis administration said it agreed to release contract information because power prices have dropped easing competitive pressures ex worker duke manipulated market by bill ainsworth union tribune staff writer june sacramento a former operator at duke energy s chula vista plant said he was told frequently by company officials during the past year to alter the plant s output in a way that may have boosted electricity prices the operator jimmy olkjer said he was even ordered to cut power generation during energy emergencies when the state faced rolling blackouts because of a scarce supply of electricity he said he believes reducing the electricity generation helped the company charge higher prices it looks like that s what they were doing olkjer said in an interview he and another former plant employee said that during the past year the company regularly operated its least efficient turbine possibly to justify higher prices the allegations which they plan to repeat today at a state senate hearing investigating power generators provide the first insider evidence that duke energy may have manipulated output at its south bay plant to drive up prices duke based in north carolina leases the south bay plant from the san diego unified port district a march report by the independent system operator which manages california s electricity grid alleged that by withholding power duke and four other owners of generating plants have contributed to billions of dollars in overcharges to california consumers tom williams spokesman for duke energy north america said that varying the output of the generating units at the chula vista plant had nothing to do with trying to achieve higher prices he said the changes in output helped balance the state s grid by dancing in the market providing flexibility for grid managers by allowing the plant to add or reduce power quickly williams added that the aging south bay plant produced as many megawatts last year as it did in olkjer served as a plant operator for years mostly when the plant was owned by san diego gas electric co after duke took over the plant workers were guaranteed their jobs for two years in april when that period ended duke laid off olkjer and other workers now he is retired during the two years duke has managed the plant olkjer said operators frequently got calls from officials with duke energy trading and marketing in salt lake city telling them to adjust their production schedule some employees at the plant monitored the hourly price of electricity posted by the independent system operator and recognized a correlation he said we noticed that a lot of times when the price was down our megawatts would go down he said if the price was up often the megawatts would go up olkjer said he was never told why he was being ordered to turn the plant s output up and down when he asked he said company officials told him it was none of his business still he was puzzled particularly when he was told to throttle down the plant during electricity emergency alerts as he says he did jan when the state declared a stage alert with the possibility of rolling blackouts it doesn t make sense to cycle up and down when there s a stage alert he said duke spokesman williams said the company may turn down units at the orders of the iso during a stage alert because the grid manager can find cheaper power somewhere else lisa szot spokeswoman at the iso said she couldn t determine whether the iso had ordered duke to power down its chula vista plant jan olkjer said the frequent adjustments of power production which sometimes occurred every half hour wear out the plant s equipment it s harder on the machinery he said it s like driving down the street putting your foot on the gas and then slamming on the brake before deregulation olkjer said the four units at chula vista which have the capacity to produce megawatts had been operated steadily during much of their history s david freeman formerly general manager of los angeles department of water and power and now chief energy adviser to gov gray davis said rapid cycling had become more common under deregulation and is hard on equipment we had almost megawatts of generating capacity down for repair last winter said freeman referring to what industry experts agreed was an extraordinary level of plant outages over several months sdg e which built the chula vista plant in the s sold it to the port district for million in the port leased the plant to duke energy for years in what critics are now calling a sweetheart deal the company pays minimal rent but has made large profits in the first quarter of this year duke which owns three other plants in california said profits rose percent to million from energy sales and trading duke may hold the record for charging the highest price for electricity it asked per megawatt hour this year by comparison before the energy crisis began electricity sold for around per megawatt hour an amount which powers about homes federal regulators have ordered the company to refund million to the state for charging excessive prices unless the company can justify them in may the company offered to pay the state to settle any price gouging investigations but gov gray davis declined olkjer and ed edwards jr who worked at the plant for years before being laid off in april said they couldn t understand why duke ran the inefficient high cost turbine unit during the past year while other generators sat idle they said they believed it may have been an attempt to fetch a higher price for electricity because the company got extra fees when it ran williams the duke spokesman said the opposite was true he said duke ran the small turbine more frequently because it was less expensive it ran on jet fuel which was cheaper than the natural gas powering the other units edwards said the smaller unit was run so hard that it was destroyed it ran so frequently and so hard it needed extensive repairs he said edwards told cbs news last night that plant outages at chula vista were prolonged because one supervisor ordered him to dump spare parts the former power plant employees said they felt compelled to come forward because they saw the impact the power crisis was having on their community it kind of irritated me because you know there s people on a fixed income that can t afford a big utility bill said olkjer staff writer craig d rose contributed to this story estimates of power profits disputed electricity a study of overcharges by suppliers may be flawed state officials say davis quoted the figures to congress by doug smith robert j lopez and rich connell times staff writers gov gray davis contention that california has been nicked for billions of dollars in inflated electricity costs is based on a study that state officials concede may have significant flaws according to interviews and confidential government documents those costs estimated by the state to be as high as billion were central to davis testimony this week before a u s senate committee where he again denounced power wholesalers and urged federal regulators to give us back the money that was wrongly taken from us the governor s impassioned demand however was based on shaky calculations the formulas are being reworked said charles robinson vice president of california s grid operator which prepared the study robinson said he had no idea how much the amount allegedly overcharged by the generators might change for now he said the agency stands by the numbers but internal documents from the california independent system operator warn that some of the financial assumptions used to quantify the alleged excess profits could be well off the mark what s more the documents caution against relying on the agency s study as a basis for allegations of overcharging as davis did during his testimony wednesday that warning was particularly important because the documents provide for the first time a detailed accounting of how much each energy supplier prospered from the state s power troubles between last summer and february the largest amounts were charged by four out of state power companies according to the confidential cal iso report okalhoma based williams cos led the group with million followed by duke energy with million southern company energy marketing now mirant with million and reliant energy services with million when told of the alleged profiteering attributed to them executives of the companies insisted the numbers were grossly overstated because of cal iso s poor methodology duke spokesman tom williams said his company s entire energy earnings for north america were less than the amount it was accused of reaping unfairly in california it doesn t add up it doesn t come close to adding up williams said what cal iso has done is highly irresponsible math paula hall collins a williams cos spokeswoman said the firm would need to study the iso report further but generally she said such reports fail to fully account for electricity production costs we maintain that we have not overcharged and that we have operated legally reliant spokesman richard wheatley also questioned the figures saying there s a lot of misinformation out of there a mirant spokesman said we haven t overcharged we haven t manipulated we haven t withheld even some firms alleged to have overcharged to a much lesser degree were outraged joe ronan vice president for government and regulatory relations at calpine said the million attributed to his company doesn t bear any relation to reality anybody can throw out any number he said it s like mccarthyism where is the evidence a spokeswoman for davis conceded that his refund figure was an estimate but defended it as reasonable it s no surprise that the people that are gouging us want to dispute an estimate of how much they re gouging us senior advisor nancy mcfadden said despite the cautions expressed in the cal iso documents officials thursday insisted they were not troubled that the governor referred to the agency s figures as potential overcharges the way it should be characterized is the amount paid above a competitive benchmark said robinson who is also cal iso s general counsel the first version of the now disputed cal iso study was made public in march it estimated that power sellers earned billion in excess profits between may and last february the report later revised upward to billion became a crucial element of the davis administration s campaign against alleged electricity price gougers this week just before davis appearance in congress the study was updated again adding another billions in alleged excess profits through may the orginal study which did not include actual pricing data was mostly intended to prod federal regulators into seeking information from generators that the state had been denied robinson said thus far the federal energy regulatory commission has ordered refunds of only million next week ferc is convening an unusual settlement conference aimed at addressing the outstanding claims by the state as well as those of sellers who claim they are owed hundreds of millions of dollars by california utilities one encouraging signal for state officials came this week when ferc reiterated an earlier order that duke energy pay millions in refunds the order stemmed from the company s sale of electricity at a megawatt hour for thousands of hours ferc s order said duke s pricing had resulted in million in billings a fair price for that power would have been per megawatt hour the agency said tom williams a

complete the deal a failure by edison to refinance million in bank debt that comes due june and an additional million in notes due in july could put the company precariously close to bankruptcy and cast a shadow on california s plan to sell billion in bonds to pay for power purchases said dan scotto a bond analyst at pnb paribas in new york even though it would at first appear to be a company setback it would really be a major setback for the state said scotto who added that edison s credit troubles could translate into higher prices for california s proposed bond offering edison however said thursday that the deal is moving forward we believe our deal is going well and we are comfortable with it said jo ann goddard vice president for investor relations she declined to discuss other details of the offering goldman sachs group edison s investment bank expects to formally price the offering monday edison officials would not comment on the proposed price of the note offering but

that comes due this year and to insulate itself from a possible bankruptcy of its ailing utility unit the utility southern california edison has lost billions of dollars on electricity sales over the last year the high interest rate on edison s proposed sale of seven year notes is about double what a credit worthy company would pay for a similar bond or note issue and would add a premium amounting

junk or speculative bonds and corporate bonds with similar ratings are going out at to edison originally started marketing the issue at a full two percentage points higher than what analysts initially expected but then raised the rate to in recent days because it was finding few takers on wall street the word is that they couldn t get people interested and that they might not be able to get it done said kurt stabel a money manager at street asset management in newport beach the higher rate however might be pulling investors out of the woodwork and has increased the chance that edison will pull off the deal scotto said this never promised to be a day at the beach scotto said i think it is really a question of find the right price the price at which people feel comfortable with the risk both stabel and scotto said that edison s note offering is unusually complicated and requires far more explaining or selling than typical corporate offerings mission energy holding co a company created by

and nearby homeowners an energy company announced thursday that it was abandoning its plan to build a power plant on the site of a proposed state park in the baldwin hills la jolla energy development inc in a letter to the state energy commission said it was withdrawing its application for fast track approval of the megawatt plant and will not pursue the baldwin facility in the future we listened to the community la jolla president steve wilburn said in an interview thursday we need to find another place for this equipment the project was to be a joint venture between la jolla and stocker resources an oil company that leases the land where the trailer sized natural gas plant would sit stocker officials said they will decide in the next few days whether they will pursue the project at this point it s just la jolla pulling out stocker spokesman steve rusch said but most observers said it would be difficult to move forward on the fast track schedule the state has implemented to relieve the energy crisis the state commission was scheduled to decide whether to approve the project today in sacramento but the hearing has been canceled the news sparked elation among environmentalists and nearby homeowners who had fought the proposal on grounds that it would pollute neighborhoods and threaten an ambitious plan to piece together acres of public open space in the hills we re getting ready to have the biggest party said tony nicholas president of the hills united homeowners assn this shows how a community can come together for a common goal and mobilize the people in a matter of days about of the residents in the hills are african american and many saw the issue as a matter of environmental justice in addition stocker and la jolla were seeking approval for the plant within days of filing their application under the governor s emergency power orders by following this fast tracked procedure they would have been able to avoid the normal time consuming environmental review process that angered opponents even further and nearly people showed up at a public hearing monday to fight the project but what officials said turned the tide against the project at a time when the energy commission is approving such plants as fast as possible was testimony from a south coast air quality management official who said his agency would not be able to approve the plant quickly executive director barry wallerstein said his agency would have to conduct hearings that would take up to days pushing construction well beyond a sept deadline set by the governor for fast track projects he also said it was unlikely stocker could get needed exemptions from federal clean air laws in a letter to the energy commission this week wallerstein wrote it appears that the baldwin energy facility could not begin operation until some time in the first part of at the earliest by wednesday night the energy commissioner who presided over the public hearings issued a statement recommending that the rest of the commission deny the application for a plant citing wallerstein s concerns conservationists embraced the outcome as a sign that the movement to create a park was gaining steam the baldwin hills conservancy was created last year with the idea of creating green space for the densely populated neighborhoods of south los angeles with support from the governor and local politicians the state recently bought a acre parcel in the area for an unprecedented million this is a great day for the baldwin hills and all the people who have worked so hard to bring this world class vision to reality said esther feldman president of community conservancy international and the main organizer to build the park also applauding la jolla s decision were state sen kevin murray d culver city and assemblyman herb wesson d culver city who had come out strongly against the project they and others questioned whether the small amount of power provided by the facility coming online after the dog days of summer would do much to relieve the energy crisis i m ecstatic wesson said at this point the environment has won the plant would have sat on what is a working oil field about feet from the kenneth hahn state recreation area and according to park proponents it would lie in the middle of the grander state conservancy on what would be a half mile bridge of land arching over la cienega boulevard rusch the spokesman for stocker said much of the information circulating about the trailer sized plant is false the plan did not call for a stack with billowing smoke he said if the issue is air quality we ve cleaned air quality up in the last decade rusch said the company s existing oil pumps on the property have reduced nitrogen oxide emissions from tons to tons a year the power plant with two foot stacks would ultimately add about tons a year he said the company was trying to cut its energy bills by providing its own power to pump oil while also contributing an extra megawatts to the state grid during the energy crisis residents say there are more desolate places for the state to relieve the energy problem said mary ann green president of the blair hills

june associated press url pdt san francisco ap when power supplies stretch thin across the west this summer who will decide whether silicon valley computers washington apple orchards or las vegas casinos get first dibs on what s left it s a key question raised by the decision of federal energy regulators this week to cap electricity prices throughout the west using a formula based on california s power costs economists energy industry executives and officials in all states are beginning to analyze the fit of this new piece in the energy puzzle though most call the order a good step that could prevent price gouging others worry the pricing system could lead to electricity shortages for california s neighbors or prompt utilities to stock up on power contracts to fend off shortages that could diminish any leverage power buyers might have as they compete for the remaining megawatts available each day tying the highest possible power price to california could cause a problem come winter when power demand drops in the golden state said gary ackerman director of the western power trading forum which represents most sellers of energy states where consumers need electricity to heat furnaces through the winter would be unable to outbid each other above the price cap which is usually determined by a formula based on the highest bid for last minute power during the most recent energy supply emergency in california that may leave power wholesalers and not a free market to decide who gets the energy certainly california has a tremendous pull on our prices and has for probably the last year said claudia rapkoch spokeswoman for montana power co which supplies natural gas and electricity to two thirds of the big sky state what it means for this winter we re just going to have to wait and see california utilities had much more control over power supplies before deregulation in obligated them to sell off their power plants to encourage competition this brought lower prices for a time but gave control over power supplies to wholesalers that aren t obligated by state law to serve the serve the best interests of local customers rather than appointing one power grid manager to decide how to divide power in the west ackerman predicts utilities in non deregulated states will simply sell their power within their borders that would hurt california which this week imported about percent of its electricity and its remaining supply from local plants owned by out of state power companies price cap or not utilities in the region will watch out for each other as best they can because they might need the favor returned said charles reinhold executive consultant for electric resources strategies in ariz saddled with rising bills that threatened to

exorbitant electricity prices in january and february the federal energy regulatory commission first ordered the refunds on march and duke responded by filing a challenge but the commission on monday rejected the company s appeal and reiterated its earlier order claiming duke had abused its power in the california energy market when it sold power for per megawatt hour we will not tolerate abuse of market power or anticompetitive bidding or behavior the commission said duke acknowledged this month that it had charged per megawatt for about megawatt hours sold to the state s major utilities in january and february netting it more than million in receivables the commission did not specify how much money duke should refund but it directed the company to readjust its january billings for those hours to a price of from a ferc document it appears that about hours occurred in january which would result in a total refund for that month of million duke is one of the companies that have been identified by both the california independent system operator the manager of the state s electricity grid and the ferc as having exercised market power and overcharged californians for electricity

humid degree heat this week in an area behind the capitol known as the house swamp the nation was watching and after months of political free fall his message seemed to be taking hold california has been bilked out of billion while the federal energy regulatory commission was asleep at the switch davis declared repeating testimony he had delivered hours earlier in the air conditioned confines of a senate hearing room wiping a bead of sweat from his brow as television cameras and two dozen reporters recorded the scene the california governor apparently couldn t resist taking another shot for nearly a year i ve been pounding on this commission to enforce the law the state s energy crisis with its volatile spot markets out of state generators and dearth of alternative energy providers is a dizzyingly complex policy puzzle the politics are much simpler democrats present themselves as consumer crusaders defending helpless utility customers from greedy energy conglomerates and misguided regulators republicans portray themselves as stewards of the free market and long term solutions rejecting price caps and refunds as heavy handed overreactions with soviet style results the democratic populism seems to be winning the battle though the debate is far from settled the consumer oriented approach to california s energy woes has raised their hopes of winning back the house of representatives in and the white house in republicans are scared out of their minds about this said one gleeful democrat on capitol hill who suggested that the white house s lackadaisical response to california s problems would rile consumers from coast to coast this could rival pete wilson s alienation of latinos said the democrat referring to the former republican governor s strident stand against illegal immigrants which many blame for the party s weak standing in california a sign of the gop s concern surfaced this week with television ads financed by anonymous sources but produced by republican party strategists that blame the democratic governor for california s energy problems democrats who long have worried that the crisis could cost davis a second term now take credit for having pressured the white house and federal regulators to take a more active role the federal energy regulatory commission which had previously resisted such efforts took steps toward controlling wholesale electricity prices monday later in the week two commissioners appointed by president bush testified that they might be open to further price restrictions and support huge refunds to california and just yesterday vice president dick cheney who has been among california s most vocal critics told senate democrats behind closed doors that he could support refunds to california if federal regulators agreed according to those in the meeting there is no doubt in my mind that action taken by federal regulators was the direct result of pressure for price relief led primarily by the california delegation davis said the pressure did not come only from democrats republican lawmakers some of whom fear the crisis could cost them seats in wrote ferc last week requesting commissioners to take further actions to help the state the democrats public relations success follows an effort by the party to raise the profile of its consumer crusade hardly a day has passed in the past several weeks without a group of democrats holding a news conference to attack the white house the republican controlled house or ferc for inaction but it may have just as much to do with a white house that has been far more focused on long term energy production than the immediate concerns of californians even as it engaged in a legitimate policy dispute over how to solve the power mess the bush administration appeared indifferent to the plight of residents experiencing skyrocketing energy bills and rolling blackouts bush tried to correct that impression with a trip to the state last month but the damage appears to have extended beyond california a cbs news new york times poll released this week of adults from across the country showed that only one in three voters approved of the job bush was doing on energy more than half the respondents said that protecting the environment was a higher priority than producing energy yet barely one in said that bush shared that priority some republicans say that bush was in a no win position contending that anything he did would have been attacked by california s opportunistic governor politics is davis main objective and i don t see the bush administration being that way said rep george radanovich r fresno the question for some analysts is whether democrats might have been too successful by pressuring the federal government to take a more active role democrats may lose their ability to point the finger at a convenient scapegoat davis has always needed rate caps much less than he needed a scapegoat now that ferc has given him what he wants or close enough to it it s a lot harder for him to lay blame back on washington when the blackouts kick in said dan schnur a gop analyst based in san francisco e mail marc sandalow at

francisco chronicle url as state legislators consider gov gray davis deal to buy part of the power grid in california a public records advocacy group filed a lawsuit yesterday demanding that the state release a report on potential health hazards of living near high voltage transmission lines the document could be vital to how legislators vote on the billion deal to buy southern california edison s power lines said terry francke general counsel for the california first amendment coalition which filed the lawsuit in alameda county superior court the power line deal was brokered by the governor to help the cash strapped utility legislators must approve the power grid purchase by aug or the utility can back out davis also has a billion agreement to purchase san diego gas and electric s power grid which also would require the legislature s approval pacific gas and electric has not agreed to sell its transmission lines the power lines report was completed in april by california electric and magnetic fields program an agency set up by the state department of health services to study the issue francke said both state agencies and their directors are named in the lawsuit efforts to keep the report secret are suspect francke said if it s known there s some danger do you want the state owning that liability he asked the study began in after the state public utilities commission committed million for research and education on the subject francke said the state document deals with scientific findings on how magnetic and electric fields from transmission lines affect humans and possible policies based on those findings he said the report was scheduled to be released to the public on may but at the last minute the public utilities commission apparently instructed the staff of the emf program to keep the reports secret the lawsuit said state health services spokeswoman lea brooks said that the report was only a draft and that her department was following orders from the puc the puc wanted to see the draft before it is released she said we prepared the report for them we are following their request brooks refused comment on the lawsuit saying her office hadn t seen it puc officials were not available for comment studies on the effects of magnetic fields have resulted in no clear consensus on their effects francke said that s what makes the state study important for legislators to consider before voting on the governor s deal to buy transmission lines he said opponents of the power grid deals say the report may add to objections to davis agreements with the utilities some legislators would rather the state help build more power generators in california they are extra nails in the coffin said james fisfis spokesman for state assembly minority leader dave cox r fair oaks we have fundamental issues with the transmission lines but when you start stacking these items up you have an undigestible deal davis spokesman roger salazar said he believed the governor hadn t seen the health hazard report obviously if something pops up and is an issue you ll take a look at it but i don t think we re at that point yet he said an alameda county superior court

christian berthelsen chronicle staff writer friday june san francisco chronicle url there s trouble in texas enron corp the houston power firm that s profited mightily during california s energy crisis is suffering a surprising lack of popularity on wall street while all eyes have been on enron s enormous profits here and its enormous pull in washington d c the reputed titan of the newly incarnated free wheeling power industry has lost half its market capitalization more than billion since its peak in august forgive californians for savoring a bit of schadenfreude over the houston boys reversal of fortunes but what gives isn t this the company that was fattening up on the backs of the state s beleaguered utilities residents and state budget isn t this the company with such close ties to the bush administration that kenneth lay enron s chairman was reported to have interviewed a candidate for a job on the commission that regulates his company yup that enron on monday enron shares hit a week low of after the federal energy regulatory commission decided to apply the same price controls to power marketers such as enron that had applied to power generating companies for months that s a far cry from august when the company s shares peaked at there s a whole kaleidoscope of issues that enron is being challenged with in the marketplace right now none of which on the surface is a major deal said donato j eassey an analyst with merrill lynch global securities in houston but when you combine them all i think what s happening here is you have a crescendo with this ferc announcement you have people saying ok the growth rate is now in question that growth rate was an eye popping percent in revenues for the united states on a two year average and nearly percent in the rest of the world enron officials did not respond to a request for interviews but as the stock continued to drop tuesday morning chief executive jeff skilling issued a statement to the markets in which he reiterated strong confidence in its earnings guidance the stock rebounded slightly throughout the week closing at yesterday in a speech at the commonwealth club last night skilling blamed regulatory interference with the free market for investor flight from his company our stock prices have gotten hammered he said they re half what they were a year ago tumbling stock prices weren t the only bad news for skilling last night a protester pelted the executive with a berry pie just before he began speaking as skilling used paper towels to wipe the pie from his face a woman was arrested on battery and malicious mischief charges enron isn t the only company with stock prices that soared in tandem with california s power crisis and are now suddenly headed south shares of reliant energy inc aes inc and williams companies inc which generate and sell electricity in california and el paso energy corp which sells natural gas here are all trading near week lows the main culprit appears to be the suddenly serious talk in washington about power price controls re regulation and now the possibility of big refunds being ordered for california even calpine corp of san jose which has developed a reputation as an industry good guy because it has not played the spot market and has not been accused of manipulative tactics dropped nearly percent yesterday to but none of the companies has been hit as hard as enron such a drastic drop in market capitalization poses serious problems for any company it leaves it less money to invest in its own growth and because executive compensation is so closely tied to stock price a sharp decline makes it more difficult to retain talented leaders while enron s power wholesaling division seems to be doing fine the firm has been buffeted by disappointments in other lines of business and other regions in recent months in the financial press the continuing knock on enron is that its business lines are so new and complex and the company is so secretive about its operations that analysts and fund managers don t feel confident in their understanding of what it does a look at the firm s recent troubles exemplifies its diversity for instance enron has engaged in repeated battles with the state government of maharashtra in india over a megawatt power plant there the dahbol power co which is percent controlled by enron stopped construction on a second phase of the project on sunday claiming it is owed million by the maharashtra state electricity board the state has accused enron of charging too much and not generating enough and stopped buying power from the plant last month closer to home enron has struggled with its investments in fiber optic bandwidth the company buys and sells unused high speed bandwidth space treating it like a commodity as it does electricity coal or natural gas but the fiber optic sector has imploded in recent weeks as it has become clear that for all the long distance cable laid in the ground there have not been enough last mile connections set up for users to actually take advantage of it earlier this year enron scuttled plans for a joint venture with blockbuster to offer what it called video on demand in which customers at home would be able to select a video of their choice for a fee and have it transmitted via fiber optic cables then there was the ferc ruling for months the agency had resisted aggressive price controls in the west preferring to let the market run its course but as control of the u s senate was handed to democrats this month and president bush appointed a tough texan regulator named patrick wood iii to the commission the agency changed its tune it expanded price controls to all hours of the day spread the controls throughout the western region and brought previously excluded power marketers under the tent so under current calculations that means enron could sell power for no more than per megawatt in a shortage and about during normal hours far short of the hundreds of dollars that companies were regularly charging during the past year in part the company s gyrating stock price reflects the volatile nature of the businesses enron has decided to pursue and the hard charging company has a reputation for going aggressively into entirely new markets but sometimes that approach gets it in trouble as was the case last year when enron had to take a million charge for its failed investment in azurix a global water company that set out to make a commodity out of water supply the same way it had done for electricity service as governments privatized their water systems the opportunities never materialized add it all together and enron has a tough time supporting a price earnings ratio of nearly considerably above the liberal standard of health which is the company had less than billion in profits on more than billion in revenues last year still a survey by thomson financial first call found that analysts expect enron to deliver earnings of cents per share in the second quarter up from cents last year and per share on the year most maintain a strong buy rating on the stock but investors with big positions in enron have taken a hit hardest put of them will be the janus funds which as enron s largest mutual fund investor held nearly billion of its stock as of the end of april in a semiannual report to investors john schreiber a portfolio manager said the stock price of the new age energy merchant was a victim of negative psychology resulting from the california energy crisis janus declined to make fund managers available for interviews there are tremendous rewards for being first into new markets said raymond niles an energy analyst with salomon smith barney in new york when you re an aggressive first mover from time to time you re going to make mistakes but i don t think any of the mistakes enron has made hit the core of the company e mail christian berthelsen at cberthelsen sfchronicle com san

mercury news sacramento bureau sacramento one of the largest companies producing power in california ordered workers to throw out spare parts and shut down equipment in an effort to drive up the price of electricity former power plant workers said thursday speaking out on the eve of appearances at a state senate hearing the three men offered the strongest evidence yet that at least one power producer duke energy sought to make more money by creating an artificial shortage that may have created huge electricity price spikes their intent in my opinion was to boost the price up said glenn johnson a mechanic who worked for two decades at the chula vista power plant now run by duke if i ve got the only box of penicillin in town and you re sick i can charge a million dollars a box he said if you want to live you re going to have to pay officials at duke angrily challenged the accusations calling them irresponsible charges by disgruntled workers who were let go in april their allegations are just comical just highly erroneous said tom williams a spokesman for duke which runs four plants in california that produce enough energy for nearly million homes the charges come as the state heads into negotiations next week with generators over the billion the state claims its consumers have been overcharged duke based in charlotte n c came under considerable criticism when it disclosed that it charged the state a record a megawatt hour for power in january federal officials have called the charge unreasonable and ordered duke to refund california the money the employees who first made their allegations public on cbs evening news thursday night will be the only witnesses today at an energy crisis hearing headed by lawmakers who suspect that power companies have been illegally gouging california state sen joe dunn d garden grove chairman of a committee investigating price gouging said the allegations raise serious concerns while we still need to hear the other side of the story from duke if there s any truth to the information i believe it would be devastating to the generators he said perfectly good parts in interviews with the mercury news thursday night the three former plant workers said that they were directed to scale back energy production and throw out good spare parts that kept the plant from getting up to full power for weeks ed edwards who worked in the southern california plant said that he was told to get rid of many boxes of good spare parts edwards said he tossed more than pallets of parts into a dumpster i don t know why they were throwing away perfectly good parts he said it didn t make sense johnson said the lack of on site parts prevented workers from quickly fixing problems that reduced the amount of power the plant could produce sometimes he said it took weeks to get parts johnson s suspicions of gouging were echoed by jimmey olkjer who spent years in the plant and worked as an assistant control operator even at times when california regulators were warning residents the state might not be able to find enough energy to prevent imminent blackouts olkjer said he was directed to scale back the amount of electricity the plant was producing in hindsight it looks to me like they were manipulating the power olkjer said duke called the allegations baseless and said the workers didn t understand the reasons for the actions continued accusations repetitive investigations and inflammatory rhetoric concerning the company s operations in the state are distracting attention from the true issue of solving california s energy crisis duke said in a statement williams did not directly dispute the worker s allegations but he said they did not understand the reasons behind the decisions state directives duke cut back on the amount of power it was producing in response to directives from state regulators at the independent system operator which runs the power grid williams said they did not know that the iso was instructing them to go up and down to meet supply and demand he said an iso spokeswoman said that the grid manager sometimes asks generators to produce more or less power to adjust traffic on the transmission system or respond to the state s electricity needs some companies bid power into the reserve market which means these plants run only when the extra energy is tapped iso officials say they are prohibited from discussing individual bids as for the spare parts williams said they were eliminated as unnecessary after duke bought the plants from san diego gas electric williams said duke has one of the best performance records in the state with its power plants off line for unscheduled maintenance only about percent of the time all three workers were given severance packages and let go in april but edwards disputed any contention that they were trying to get back at duke i m not a disgruntled employee he said i m just telling the truth of what i saw the last two years i worked there no matter what the reasons were for the decisions duke has made huge profits during the california energy crisis and those profits apparently created good cheer among duke executives at one party johnson said executives gleefully celebrated their good fortune we re making more money than we ever thought possible johnson quoted the plant s manager as saying mercury news staff writer john woolfolk contributed to this report contact dion nissenbaum at dnissenbaum sjmercury com or enron chief gov davis not to blame for energy crisis by karen gaudette associated press writer san francisco ap california gov gray davis isn t to blame for california s power crisis and neither are electricity wholesalers a texas energy executive told a crowd at the commonwealth club of california jeffrey skilling ceo and president of houston based enron corp wiped away the remnants of a pie hurled by a protester thursday and placed the blame squarely on california s energy regulators the state public utilities commission in the early s put together a broken market by preventing utilities to pass along the full cost of power and discouraging power contracts that would have lowered dependence on buying last minute power skilling said because of these rules the power consumers of the state of california were thrown totally to the mercy of the spot market skilling said puc president loretta lynch defended the regulators actions last week saying utilities have been free to enter into long term contracts utilities countered that the puc never made clear what contracts it would accept which left open the possibility they would later be overruled i think consumers in california are angry and they should be skilling said prices in california shouldn t be as high as they are skilling also congratulated davis for california s unprecedented conservation denied accusations that enron chairman kenneth lay personally interviewed candidates for the federal energy regulatory commission which oversees interstate energy markets told the audience to expect a report that would show california municipal utilities have profited the most selling power to the state said price caps ordered by ferc earlier this week would likely damage the markets and would only exacerbate the problem acknowledged that municipal utilities in the state have managed to provide cheaper power to their customers and even profit from the power crisis by selling off extra power despite public control enron has come under fire after accusations from davis and state officials that it and other energy companies forced electricity prices skyward by holding back supply enron denies such claims and joins other power producers in arguing that the state and utilities still owe them billions in unpaid bills davis acknowledges that pacific gas electric co which has declared bankruptcy and southern california edison together still owe generators such as enron duke energy mirant and reliant energy about billion for past electricity sales our success is linked to efficient markets not higher prices in california or anywhere else skilling said protesters gathered outside the building wearing pig masks and carrying hand made signs one of which read greed is the only power crisis it s basically enron and the other companies raising prices said bernard greening a santa clara computer programmer who said he s unhappy with the record prices for electricity and natural gas pete snoek of tiburon said he believed what skilling had to say i believe the energy situation has been politicized so badly snoek said saying he was one of several in the audience to shush protesters during the meeting i hear the same people out there as if it s a sin to make any money in this country state officials counter that wholesalers charged as much as billion in illegal overcharges dating back to may companies have said california s claims are wildly exaggerated the federal energy regulatory commission has already estimated that wholesalers owe california million in overcharges for the first four months of the year davis and others say that s a mere drop in the bucket enron has also been tied to president bush s hands off approach to the energy crisis company chairman kenneth lay is a friend and one of the largest campaign contributors to bush and the gop several prominent members of the bush administration hold stock in the company enron is one of several major gop donors accused of meeting secretly with vice president dick cheney as he drafted the bush administration s energy plan enron is one of the world s leading electricity natural gas and communications companies with billion in revenues in it owns miles of pipeline has employees and is active in countries during the first quarter of this year enron s revenues increased percent to billion three say company purposely cut power ex duke workers say repairs were curbed in order to manipulate output june by kimberly kindy the orange county register former duke energy employees ed edwards left glenn johnson center and jimmy olkjer are to appear before a state senate committee today photo dave yoder the register three former duke energy workers say they were ordered to tamper with equipment at a san diego county power plant causing mechanical problems that helped drive up electricity prices during the state s energy crisis the workers say they will offer eyewitness testimony to a state senate committee today the first public accounts from power plant employees of how energy production may have been manipulated duke officials deny most of the allegations the whistle blowers mechanics ed edwards and glenn johnson and control room operator jimmy olkjer lost their jobs four months ago state sen joe dunn the santa ana democrat who is chairing the investigative committee on price fixing said his staff will attempt to verify the accounts from the whistle blowers but their mere presence in a capitol hearing room is expected to set off a media circus and if the accusations are true it could have wide ranging effects on the north carolina company s operations in california duke officials were working late into the night to prepare for the hearing and have scheduled a news conference later today they were doing all kinds of things that didn t make sense johnson said in an interview but if you asked them why to explain they told you to shut up and do your job the testimony comes on the heels of a federal energy regulatory commission ruling thursday ordering duke to refund million in overcharges for january this information lends credence to the concern that there was a deliberate strategy for outages for the sole purpose of impacting price dunn said what they are saying is disturbing duke energy spokesman tom williams said the fact that the former workers lost their jobs may be shaping their testimony the proof is in the pudding production is up and we ve had fewer forced outages since we ve taken over said williams but control room logs obtained by the orange county register show duke s trading arm ordered its south bay power plant in chula vista to reduce production minutes after stage three alerts were issued the logs are for january the same month that duke was accused of overcharging in california the three former duke workers each worked at the chula vista plant for more than two decades when it was owned by san diego gas electric they lost their jobs when duke assembled a new team to run the plant the three whistle blowers outlined their accusations in interviews with the register the accusations include the company ordered workers to throw unopened boxes of bolts steam seals valves and other parts into dumpsters the parts were needed to perform routine maintenance but were no longer available when repairs were required duke officials acknowledge that new parts were discarded but say the high inventory tax made it more efficient to order parts as needed because they could be delivered within hours edwards and johnson say they were ordered to dismantle critical equipment necessary for the generating units to run at full capacity because parts were thrown away they couldn t make repairs and generators ran at diminished capacity for days or weeks energy experts say this allegation if true would allow duke to withhold energy from the marketplace which could drive up the price duke officials counter that production has increased at its power plants and forced outages have decreased since they took over but in late there was a spike in outages at the chula vista plant according to records kept by the state s power grid operator the plant reported hours of outages from october through december there were relatively few outages before that the mechanics say the inability to perform repairs forced them to use a small expensive generator that was rarely powered up before duke took over the plant experts say that could have been used to exploit federal rules allowing generators to justify prices based on the costliest units online olkjer says he received orders from duke s trading arm to reduce production then when energy prices jumped he would get new instructions to power up again duke officials did not respond to olkjer s claim stanford professor frank wolak an expert in california s energy market said that if their testimony can be proven the state could be refunded millions of dollars and future energy prices could be dramatically reduced what they are saying is amazing this is a classic plot i ve always wondered how they kept the generators out for so long said wolak who heads an electricity market surveillance for the california agency that oversees the buying and selling of power they were very happy to have them off line because it allowed them to make more money wolak said the testimony seems to back up research conducted by the state independent system operator which runs most of the state s power grid and oversees the buying and selling of electricity in california in a report to federal regulators iso said that from may to november duke withheld electricity from the state s power grid percent of the time the report accused more than a dozen power plant companies of powering down generators to create scarcity in the marketplace that would in turn drive up prices in a separate report the state power grid operator accused duke of overcharging california again in january of this year resulting in the million refund order duke officials say charging a megawatt hour was justified during a short period of time federal regulators disagreed and said the power merchant should have charged no more than per megawatt hour williams duke s spokesman said that the company has been an ethical operator all but percent of the time we were operating that s very good said williams adding that when sdg e owned the plant forced outages took place percent of the time but dunn said that if the testimony from the whistle blowers is true and duke had the ability to manipulate prices federal regulators would be required under the federal power act to move them out of the competitive marketplace this would mean they would be moved back into a cost based market structure and would only be allowed to recover costs at a fair rate of return this would bring the prices down dramatically in california dunn said what generators fear most is being returned to cost based rate regulation allegations of market manipulation nearly a dozen investigations are under way to determine if energy producers illegally manipulated california s dysfunctional electricity market here are the main allegations was power deliberately withheld to boost prices several investigators including the public utilities commission the california attorney general and the federal energy regulatory commission are trying to determine if the largest generators and power marketers including duke reliant mirant and dynegy shut down power plants at key times federal environmental protection agency records showed times in december when tulsa based williams throttled back at midday letting williams boost profits at other plants it controlled including a huntington beach plant owned by aes corp were financial incentives offered to plant operators who shut down federal regulators have settled a case for million with williams among the allegations williams offered ffinancial incentives to aes if it would keep its plants offline williams has denied any wrongdoing did companies collude traders and producers were able to share information on web sites that helped them determine when to get the highest prices for electricity attorney general bill lockyer is investigating other allegations of collusion were workers ordered to fake outages three former duke employees will testify today that they were ordered to create malfunctions at a san diego county power plant allowing the company to command higher prices at other duke owned power plants duke denies this related stories ferc judge tackles task of generating a deal california s blackout forecasts rolled back ferc

power operators bilked our state june by dena bunis and kate berry the orange county register washington gov gray davis told anyone here who would listen wednesday that overcharges from what he calls greedy power generators have now risen to billion billion more than earlier reported and he wants that money back the governor said if the meetings federal regulators have ordered next week to try and hammer out the differences between power companies utilities and the state do not end with that kind of money in california s pocket he ll be back they must be required to give us back our money davis told the senate government affairs committee during two hours of testimony and questioning it was the first time california s chief executive has testified on the state s crisis it is unconscionable that ferc looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to billion the billion is the amount california s independent system operator says generators overcharged utilities and the state from may to may of this year it had initially calculated that between may and february there were billion in overcharges davis said those figures are a far cry from the million that the federal energy regulatory commission says were overcharges that s because ferc only looked at three months of rates and only when the state was in an energy alert the governor faced tough pointed questioning from republican members and glowing praise and sympathy for his state s plight from democratic colleagues everything from refunds to long term contracts will be on the table at next week s settlement meeting ferc has given the parties until july to make a deal if they can t the administrative judge overseeing the talks will make a recommendation to ferc which can order the paybacks sen barbara boxer introduced a bill wednesday to require refunds if ferc doesn t act not surprisingly generators don t see the refund issue the governor s way it s just crazy said tom williams a spokesman at duke energy i don t know how they re coming up with these numbers and there s skepticism about next week s talks the negotiations are going to be like the salt treaty said gary ackerman president of the western power trading forum which represents power suppliers i question whether it can happen and work out also at issue is money generators say they are owed by the utilities davis said that s about billion but power companies say it s more like billion to billion whatever the figure davis said we want to see their money in our pockets before we talk about working anything out on their end the settlement conference was part of ferc s order instituting around the clock price caps for california and its western neighbors those price caps were made possible experts agree because california lawmakers from both sides of the aisle riled up the public enough over the issue that the bush administration felt the heat the question is whether that can work with refunds pressure could come from a number of places said charles cook a nonpartisan political analyst who has followed california s crisis it could come from republican members from the state from party donors in california who president george w bush is going to have to go back to and then maybe from his economic advisers who say that california can t be allowed to go belly up davis and sen dianne feinstein d calif said new ferc commissioner patrick wood a confidant of bush has been receptive to their refund pleas that was the case wednesday when wood expected to be named ferc chairman sometime this year told members of

supporters say the board of equalization s decision could mean millions of dollars in higher taxes for electricity companies the eob will resume setting the assessed value of plants that produce at least megawatts of power and are owned by generating companies whose rates are not controlled by the state despite hot temperatures in much of the state blackouts were averted wednesday as power reserves remained above percent track the state s blackout warnings on the web at www caiso com systemstatus html in rolling blackouts together is all relative june i have a confession to make i m an n and as an n i can t help feeling a little guilty i feel guilty that i won t be called upon to share the pain of all those a s in irvine and laguna woods or the m s in costa mesa and cypress while the m s in fountain valley suffer and sweat through rolling blackouts i ll be sitting pretty because i m an n and the dirty little secret about rolling power blackouts is how many of us are out there allow me to explain as you may have heard southern california edison has been required to set up a public notification system for rolling blackouts if you hear on the news that the power guys are expecting rolling blackouts you can go to a web site www sce com or call a toll free phone number to see if your rotating outage group is on the list for going temporarily dark how do you know which group you re in on your edison power bill next to your account number there s a code that starts with a or m a a m m and so on that s your outage group number but wait there s another category of outage group if your power bill has the code number n on it it means that you re exempt from rolling blackouts you see under public utilities commission rules electric power customers who provide essential public health safety and security services such as fire and police stations hospitals jails and so on are automatically exempt from rolling blackouts even if they have emergency generators on site and because of the way electric power service is set up anybody who s on the same circuit with an essential service provider is also exempt from rolling blackouts for example my house shares a circuit with a fire station so i m an exempt n as are the other power customers on the same circuit but here s the kicker according to an edison spokesman percent of all edison customers are n s that is they share circuits with essential service providers and thus are currently exempt from rolling blackouts let me repeat that half of all edison customers are exempt from rolling blackouts for san diego gas electric customers it s percent mind you this isn t something edison likes to publicize when i asked about it for a column three months ago edison said it didn t know how many power customers are automatically exempt and when the company unveiled its blackout warning plan this week neither the edison press release nor news reports mentioned the percent exemption figure true even exempt power customers can be affected by rolling blackouts at work at the store at a traffic light still the next time you hear some power company or government official say we re all in this together don t believe it when it comes to rolling blackouts the truth is that only half of us are really all in this together and even an n can see that isn t fair,Phishing,Data

"St. Vincent Breast Center officials said patients health information may have been compromised after they sent around 63,000 letters to the wrong patients.  The letters included patient names, addresses, and in some cases, a reference to a scheduled appointment. Officials said none of the letters included social security numbers, financial information or clinical information.  St.Vincent Breast Center entered into an agreement with Indianapolis Breast Center P.C. and Solis Womens Health Breast Imaging Specialists of Indiana P.C. after they both closed last year.  On May 5, St.Vincent Breast Center mailed letters intended for prior patients of the Indianapolis Breast Center and Solis Womens Health to inform them that St.Vincent was available to provide care. Some letters also welcomed patients who had previously scheduled healthcare services.  Officials said on May 15, people who had accidentally received another persons letter began calling St.Vincent.  Rex McKinney, privacy officer for St.Vincent Indianapolis Hospital, said there is no indication that this patient information will be accessed or used.  We value the privacy and security of patient information, and regret this mailing error, said McKinney. It is our priority to support those who have been affected and make the necessary changes to our patient mailing process to avoid future occurrences. We sincerely apologize for any inconveniences resulting from this unfortunate incident.  The hospital is destroying letters that have been returned and changing its patient mailing process, according to McKinney.  ",Data Breach,Insider Misuse,0.3528170806163488,False
"On August 25, 2014, the Indian Health Service (IHS) Bemidji Area determined that a physician employed by a staffing company under contract with the IHS had improperly accessed protected health information from three IHS facilities. The three facilities affected are the Fort Yates Service Unit in the IHS Great Plains Area, the Cass Lake Service Unit in the IHS Bemidji Area, and the Crow Service Unit in the IHS Billings Area.  The data breach included patient names, Social Security numbers, and health information such as diagnoses, prescribed medications, and laboratory results. However, there is no current indication that the information has been used by or disclosed to any unauthorized individuals.  The IHS contract at issue contained the requirement that contractors must protect patient privacy and comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and its implementing regulations. Even though these protections were required as a part of the staffing company's contract with IHS, the contract provider improperly accessed these records.  ""IHS is very disappointed that this breach occurred given that the staffing company contract included the requirement that contract providers must protect patient privacy and meet HIPAA regulations. We are committed to ensuring the security and integrity of all our patients' personal information and are putting additional protections in place"" said Acting IHS Director Dr. Yvette Roubideaux. ""Keeping patient information secure is of the utmost importance to us, and we very much regret that this situation occurred.""  In accordance with regulations implementing HIPAA, the IHS has notified all persons whose information was improperly accessed. On October 17, 2014, the IHS sent letters by first class mail to the affected patients to notify them of the privacy breach. Affected patients were also provided phone numbers to call the Area HIPAA Coordinators. As a measure of added security, the IHS is offering one year of free credit monitoring and reporting services to these affected patients. Also, to help protect against further breaches, all contract staff serving the affected Areas are being required to sign a Confidentiality Agreement stating that individually identifiable information is to be held in strict confidence.",Insider Misuse,Data Breach,0.5647368121748219,False
