business highlights enron global markets coal and emissions trading the first enron online synfuel trade occurred this past week establishing enrononline as the only online marketplace for synfuel the purpose of bringing synfuel on enrononline is to provide market transparency between the coal synfuel spread the coal cash book which began trading only two months ago has traded over million spot tons the fundamental purpose of this book is to capture short term market discrepancies while also adding liquidity to the spot market to further long term trading and marketing of coal enron energy and operational services ena solid fuel initiative ena started development of a coal initiative late last year to support the electricity trading desk and to provide enron with a hedge in the event that the cost of natural gas continues to escalate above current long term projections because of the culture shock associated the use of the words enron and coal in the same sentence consideration was been given to changing the name to dng dense natural gas however we went with solid fuel initiative this initiative is developing multiple sites throughout the country where ena feels there is the greatest opportunity for long term corporate benefit the primary areas are texas florida southeastern ohio and the central rocky mountain area there are principal areas currently being aggressively pursued brownsville tx and brighton fl in brownsville the team secured formal owner approval to lease a acre site near the brownsville ship channel this approval will allow the formal permitting activities to proceed without delay a mw facility is being considered for brownsville as conceptualized it will consist of two mw net cfb units circulating fluidized bed boilers the boilers will be fired by petroleum coke petcoke and use a technology that will generate electricity in the most environmentally friendly way currently possible one of the advantages of locating this facility near brownsville is that it remains a steady growth area and there is already serious interest by others to take substantial initial base load capacity there is further synergy with other developing projects in the area that could lock down additional base capacity as stated the plant is initially mw but will be designed to be expanded to a mw facility the eeos team is starting to grow and currently includes hilda akin cheryl kent project admin assistants bill fox as pem and paula solomon as pcm as the project develops there will be more team members required in addition as the florida opportunity develops we plan to establish a separate team esource esource enron s research group recently posted on its website a forrester report as well as analyst reports for various industry and

i was disappointed to say the least at the return email i received from you so i waited before replying so as not to react in haste previously i stuck to facts and did not bring things of a personal nature into the equation i feel however that there are a few things you should know about me and how i have exemplified the enron vision so you can realize why i took this so seriously and why am to be blunt ticked off at the resolution in the years that i worked on the scheduling desk for clinton i never missed a day of work not one i never took vacation during bid week or during tie out time between i took all but days vacation between the months of may october so as not to interfere with winter gas operations i have had nothing but above average reviews in the past years been promoted twice and received special recognition for working shorthanded through the winter of as you can see i have consistently put enron ahead of personal conveniences and strived to do the right thing for the company i am distressed that the very values enron holds me to ring hollow with regards to how i have been treated changing vacation rules be it legally legitimate does not exemplify integrityin my eyes not stating a policy change there has still never been a formal statement of this change does not illustrate communication stating that i will be paid for vacation less any i take between now and the severance date is deceptive at the least and would not constitute respect excellence nor integrity fact items in the original email are true is of the most significance as the words came from the lips of our hr representative that i would be paid the vacation amount we discussed unless i took any vacation between now and june st fact at least people were allowed vacation time off during this transition susan weison sheri wallace fact if you check my vacation records you will find that i have taken a vacation every year in may my request was made like in all previous years a few weeks before i wanted to take it had i known that the rules of the game were going to be changed i would have made my intentions known earlier in conclusion i do not expect or even wish for a response i have enjoyed my time with clinton energy and enron i have learned much and forwarded my career greatly and for that i am thankful i just wanted you to know where i am coming from and how an unfortunate situation of severance was turned into one in which i leave being taught a lesson by enron that does not make me a better person just a smarter one this lesson a spotless record loyalty to a company means very little it is better to look out for in the end the company you work for is going to protect their best interests regardless of the rhetoric in their vision statement thank you for your time respectfully sean zurbrick judy gray am to sean zurbrick dub ees ees cc cindy olson corp enron enron kenneth lay corp enron enron jeff skilling corp enron enron kalen pieper hou ees ees judy gray hou ees ees ashley kerr hou ees ees tim weithman dub ees ees ken brooks dub ees ees kriste sullivan enron enronxgate subject re clinton energy vacation policy request sean thank you for bringing your concerns to us we value the input of our employees and constantly seek ways to improve the quality of our employee benefits after talking to some of the parties involved in this matter and reviewing our vacation policy we find that your management acted within the scope of its responsibility and within the bounds of our vacation policy in addition we find no evidence of inconsistencies and believe that you and your co workers at clinton have been treated equitably and fairly regarding the denial of vacation during this transition period in closing we support the decision to deny vacation requests to the clinton employees affected by this transition should you have any other questions please do not hesitate to direct them to your management sean zurbrick pm to kenneth lay corp enron enron jeff skilling corp enron enron kalen pieper hou ees ees cc judy gray hou ees ees ashley kerr hou ees ees tim weithman dub ees ees ken brooks dub ees ees subject clinton energy vacation policy request i have held discussions with tim weithman ashley kerr ken brooks immediate supervisor regarding a request for vacation for the rd or th week in may i have been told recently by both ms kerr as well as mr weithman that those of us being severed from the company are not permitted to take any vacation time between now and june st it would seem that there are several inconsistencies regarding enron policy as well as how the subject was presented both to the group as well as individually below are the inconsistencies i speak of during the group meeting in the beginning of april there was no mention of vacation freezes the only reference to time that was mentioned was that you must be employed by enron as of june to receive the severance package during my private discussion in which both ms kerr and ms gray were present i was presented with the specifics of the severance package i specifically remember being asked for my current unused vacation amount i gave them the amount of hours and was told that i would be reimbursed for that total unless of course i took any additional vacation this implied that regular enron vacation policies would be in effect again at no time was it presented to me that i was ineligible to take any of my earned vacation or that there would be any deviations from normal enron policy regarding vacation at no time has mr weithman ms gray ms kerr or any other enron agent made public a policy of vacation freezes at no time were there ever any public or private requests that the plans for those with previously scheduled vacations to be made available to any enron agent i can find nothing in my severance package that states any deviation from the standard enron vacation policy i realize that enron policy requires vacation approval from the supervising employee it states in that policy the following an employee s preference for scheduling vacation should be adopted when possible the supervisor must verify that unit staffing needs are met before approving an employee s vacation request i am currently still an enron employee i have also verified that staffing needs are met in summary as you can see there are several inconsistencies with regards to the vacation policy for those being severed at clinton energy it more than offends me that i am being prohibited from taken any part of the hours of accrued vacation that is by all accounts mine to take this being said i am formally requesting one last time that i be granted my vacation request during the month of may furthermore i would like this approval as soon as possible so that i may make necessary arrangements as you review this i am consulting an attorney so that i may be advised of my rights regarding this matter thank you sean zurbrick,Phishing,Data

spain the economy of this fishing community is as battered as its town hall where dim lights flicker in the hallways and chips of paint flake off the walls up in his second floor office the mayor juan manuel de jesus has an in tray overflowing with troubles a third of the town out of work a desperately needed fishing treaty with morocco rising crime and drug abuse and a big municipal budget deficit but this morning his thoughts revolve around a different irritant windmills look at this he says unfolding on his desk a map of the countryside surrounding barbate large yellow and green splotches a military training zone and a swarm of natural parks hem in the seaside town leaving just a pair of white slivers those are the only areas open for development he says his finger stabs one of the white areas near the atlantic coast and that s where they re putting the windmills the one place we could have built a hotel a resort something that would bring us some jobs the mayor sees the windmills as a blight on the land driving away tourists and crimping more lucrative projects local environmentalists fret that the installation with its rows of steel towers and sharp metal blades will play havoc with migrating birds and mar the coastline as they did in nearby tarifa a windsurfing mecca on the strait of gibraltar tilting at windmills is nothing new in the land of don quixote but wind power doesn t have to be like this at the opposite end of the country more than kilometers to the north in the green hills of navarra steel windmills perch on a ridge over a landscape that resembles a nature reserve cows nap in the shade of the towers and the narrow gravel access roads follow original grazing trails electricity is transformed in a nearby substation built to resemble the neighboring stone houses the approach the result of close cooperation between business and government has won accolades from environmentalists and business leaders alike spain the world s no producer of wind power has become a battleground for two competing models of developing the business the hodgepodge of unsightly wind parks seen in the south and the carefully planned and unobtrusive installations found up north the conflict is intensely local with the country building enough new windmills to more than triple its wind power capacity by but the model that prevails will have consequences far beyond the iberian peninsula anxious to clean up its environment and limit its dependence on imports of natural gas the european union has committed itself to generating of its electricity from renewable energy sources by yet less than of the eu s electricity output now comes from windmills thanks largely to poor execution and a brewing backlash if spain with its open spaces and relatively low population density can t sell the public on windmills the eu will likely find it difficult to convince europeans to accept more ambitious forms of alternative energy such as biomass plants which turn agricultural animal and human waste into energy the failure could also call into question the eu s commitment to the kyoto global warming treaty which u s president george w bush has been roundly criticized in europe for rejecting few expected this turn in events back in when the eu first set a more modest target at the time wind power looked like the fresh breeze of the future soon the union s most green minded states led by germany and denmark were busily building wind parks to the applause of environmental groups which saw wind power as a clean alternative to nuclear power and coal burning power plants but early enthusiasm led to shortsighted projects leaving the european landscape littered with inefficient wind parks germany for example quickly became the world s largest producer of wind power with megawatts of capacity installed at the end of last year but the breakneck growth has gobbled up most of the available sites for windmills prompting government officials to promise more careful planning procedures opposition is also building in denmark forcing the government to rethink a wind power subsidy program all of this spells trouble for wind power which relies heavily on government funding lower quality projects are mucking up the panorama says james stettler a renewable energy analyst with dresdner kleinwort wasserstein in london finding the right balance between wind development and environmental care would go a long way toward assuaging public opposition notably in wind rich but windmill poor britain and ireland and toward avoiding california like blackouts in spain in the years to come the danger is real says rafael miranda chairman of spanish utility endesa sa who this month urged the government to ease restrictions on new investments in power plants or risk outages one way forward can be seen in the hills of northern navarra at the installations of energia hidroelectrica de navarra sa a spanish company that specializes in renewable energy on a recent afternoon ehn official enrique huidobro races his four by four past two huge trucks on a dusty track leading up to alaiz an turbine park built in ehn s head of civil works mr huidobro is working overtime patching the land clearing debris and replanting grass around the park s latest additions big kilowatt turbines whose meter long blades whoosh over the landscape with barely a whisper ehn is spain s largest wind park developer the company has installed more than megawatts of wind capacity in spain over the past five years mostly in navarra its parks have won accolades from environmental groups and business leaders alike and company sponsored surveys show public approval ratings above one of its subsidiaries energias eolicas europeas this spring landed the biggest ever financing package in the wind sector some million euros from five european banks to build wind parks in don quixote s la mancha in south central spain the extra costs from taking care of the environment aren t questioned here says ehn s chief executive esteban morras seated beneath oil paintings of modern windmills in his office in pamplona that s the most profitable investment there is in the long run mr morras isn t just paying lip service to the green lobby a former attorney and civil servant he spent years working on water resource and energy issues in the governments of his hometown and later the region so when ehn was founded in and he became ceo he was merely taking his passion to the private sector fresh from his morning english lesson ehn is expanding into the u s eastern europe and latin america mr morras outlines what he sees as the keys to making wind power palatable careful planning environmental sensitivity and the latest in technology then he grabs a pair of binoculars and peers out the window behind his desk on the crest of a hill in the distance is ehn s newest prototype a megawatt turbine it s times bigger than the turbines first installed in southern spain yet its meter long blades spin in much gentler breezes with more machines like that mr morras says we ll have parks that are less cluttered and more reliable and economical the company s success owes a lot to the region s government navarra helped create ehn and still owns of it navarra also approved generous tax credits for companies that invest in renewable energy projects and established coherent and far reaching planning procedures for wind power across the region the strategy transformed the region from an also ran in wind power to a model of development in five years sitting in an office overlooking navarra s first wind park the regional official who guides the program reflects on the strategy it s not just about megawatts says nuria iturriagagoitia navarra s director of industry trade labor and tourism you have to consider how it affects employment education agriculture even tourism the key was having a clear idea from the beginning on how to promote and implement alternative energies ehn is the vehicle of our energy policy she ticks off details of the energy plan the government studied sites across navarra she says sketching a map of the shield shaped region on a piece of paper it ruled out of them they were virgin territory or too close to natural parks even though they were some of the best windiest sites she explains crossing out huge swaths of the hilly province in the end sites made the cut but navarra s strategy for quelling opposition didn t end there after ehn began its detailed planning mr morras held weekly public meetings with environmentalists developers and local residents we discussed every curve of every road he says everybody was included ehn unlike many spanish wind park developers also decided to have all its windmills assembled in local factories its new project in castilla la mancha for example will be supplied by a newly built local enron corp plant the approach paid off today all sites have operational wind parks five years after the first turbines started spinning some of navarra s electricity comes from wind power that compares with about for spain as a whole and for denmark the world s fourth largest wind power producer having won over the citizens of navarra the regional government and ehn are now working to educate the whole country about wind power they regularly bus students from across spain to their wind parks some of which have become tourist attractions compare this with the haphazard patchwork of windmills cropping up down south in andalusia home to one of the country s first wind parks the sprawling installation of low power windmills planted in tarifa in in wind power developers presented some projects to the regional government but andalusia had no overall plan for exploiting the region s wind swept coasts and inland hilltops the region had no plan to oversee wind power development and no uniform criteria for installing or removing windmills in the end about wind parks were approved with little thought to how much total energy they would generate for the region or how they would cumulatively affect the environment the result trucks and cranes have chewed up many pristine areas leaving behind meter high towers and concrete block substations yet wind power still generates less than of andalusia s electricity soledad bonet a spokeswoman for andalusia s environmental department acknowledges that the region has no global planning procedure for new energy installations including wind parks although the region s departments of environment labor and industry all review wind park plans individual municipal governments are essentially free to award development licenses as they see fit the crosswinds of these forces can be seen on a hilltop west of barbate where desarrollos eolicos sa the wind park unit of engineering firm abengoa sa is busy erecting a row of windmills more than towers are already in place and neighbors worry the looming turbines and gouged out access roads will create another tarifa they might be green and all says antonio aragon a taxi driver who gets an eyeful every time he wheels out of town but they sure do foul up the landscape something awful this is third world development says jose luis tirado a year old sculptor who heads of a local group of environmentalists businessmen and landowners who oppose the wind park we ve spent decades calling for alternative energy sources he says but doing it like this without any sort of planning is worse than doing nothing at all equally galling he says is that none of the wind park developers active in the region have shifted any production to local factories despite andalucia s jobless rate of more than back in barbate s town hall mayor de jesus sits at his desk and recalls how he invoked building permit irregularities to stop work on the wind park earlier this year a few months later though a local judge overruled him arguing that abengoa stood to lose its investment and that barbate would have had to reimburse the company for the cost of the whole project construction has begun again abengoa declines to comment now mr de jesus leafs through a dossier of proposed economic initiatives for his town then sets it aside with a sigh his legal battle to halt construction looks hopeless as does his chance of winning a new accord that will allow local fishermen to cast their nets in moroccan waters unemployment and drugs are slowly killing his town he says those turbines are being built there s nothing we can do about that he says but that s it we re passing a new urban plan this year there won t be any more wind park licenses in the future not here copyright dow jones company inc all rights reserved may houston chronicle struggling enron plant in india stops production by laura goldberg copyright houston chronicle enron corp s india power plant has stopped production after its sole customer stopped ordering electricity the maharashtra state electricity board had not issued dispatch instructions for power from the dabhol power co since early tuesday enron spokesman john ambler said wednesday the move by the board is the latest in a series of actions and counteractions surrounding the billion project in which enron has a percent stake though the plant can t produce power unless it has dispatch instructions the plant hasn t been shut down employees are there and the plant reportedly is operational ready to produce power the board told enron last week it was canceling a year old power purchase agreement enron says the board doesn t have the right to do so under the contract the board is supposed to pay enron whether it takes power or not said carol coale an energy analyst with prudential securities in houston but the board has already refused to pay for power saying enron isn t living up to its contract enron which says it is meeting the contract s terms is owed about million for power sold in december and january days before the board gave notice to enron the company started proceedings to end the contract because of unpaid power bills but six months must pass before enron can end it there is continued speculation that enron is looking to sell its stake in the project in a statement enron said wednesday it is still open to constructive discussions on solutions indian officials also have been talking

tansey chronicle staff writer the san francisco chronicle final a copyright california s testy relationship with federal energy regulators could turn into a showdown tomorrow when state power officials must decide whether to surrender some control over the state s electricity market or risk losing limited price curbs that kicked in this week in agreeing last month to set flexible caps to restrict price gouging during electricity shortages the federal energy regulatory commission said the state and its utilities must agree to let an independent organization manage california s power transmission lines under that setup california would be one of a group of western states sharing a linked transmission grid whose rates and access rules would be set by independent managers it is part of the commission s drive to create regional electricity markets throughout the country and make it easier to trade power across state lines the regional grids would be a prelude to the nationwide free market in electricity advocated by the bush administration and power marketers like enron but california assembly democrats who have challenged the federal demand say the requirement could interfere with some of the state s homegrown solutions to its energy crisis such as gov gray davis proposal that the state buy and run transmission lines owned by southern california edison co a lot of folks were wondering how those two things would interact and are they mutually exclusive said paul hefner an aide to assembly speaker robert hertzberg d sherman oaks other officials say the federal requirement is premature because no regional organization yet exists that california can join mike florio a board member of the california independent system operator which manages the state s power grid said california is already part of regional efforts to clear transmission bottlenecks and share surplus power but florio said no western state will rush into a regional arrangement and surrender part of its authority without ensuring a good deal for its own consumers we certainly don t want to be forced into an entity where generators or power marketers get to dictate the terms florio said this has got to be a long courtship rather than a shotgun wedding when federal regulators initiated the move toward regional transmission grids during the clinton administration in participation was voluntary said gary cohen general counsel to the state public utilities commission but in its april order the federal energy commission made its offer of limited price relief contingent on a filing by june from the independent system operator committing the state to a regional management plan the puc and the assembly are challenging that requirement if anything cohen said the state needs to increase control over its energy system while it recovers from its disastrous debut into deregulation rather than submit to a regional authority that would be overseen by the federal government this doesn t seem to be the time to be doing more experimenting cohen said we certainly have not been able to rely on ferc to look out for the interests of californians waiting for state s response curt hebert chairman of the federal commission declined to say yesterday whether the government would immediately yank the soft price caps that went into effect this week if it found the iso response unsatisfactory he said he didn t want to prejudge the case said commission spokeswoman tamara young allen he will wait to see what california files puc commissioner jeff brown said he would be willing to give up some state control of the grid in exchange for meaningful price controls but he said the federal measures granted fell far short of what california needed hell those caps are pretty toothless as they are brown said the price controls are in effect only during power shortages the cap is the price offered by the least efficient generating plant and generators can challenge any federal ruling that they have exceeded the caps by claiming high costs the controls were in place for the first time yesterday when the state declared a stage power emergency meaning reserves fell below percent of available capacity florio said state power managers answer to the federal government will probably be that they are already doing within california much of what a regional transmission organization would do iso could play a role the iso manages the grid to ensure that power gets to where it is needed in the state the organization told federal regulators in january the agency could represent california when a western regional organization develops it said the governor declined to say yesterday what stand he would take on federal regulators demand i m of a mind to do something but i still have to talk to my lawyers davis said assembly democrats say regulators in washington have no right to withhold actions to correct california s dysfunctional power market they re required to ensure that just and reasonable rates prevail in the market hefner said why should we have to dicker to get them to do the job congress created them to do copyright dow jones company inc all rights reserved news plan would have biggest customers pay edison s debt greg lucas sacramento bureau chief the san francisco chronicle final a copyright legislative leaders are drafting a new rescue plan for southern california edison that would put the utility back on its feet financially at the expense of its biggest customers the plan would leave manufacturers refineries and other big industrial customers with the burden of paying nearly all the utility s billion back debt through a dedicated charge residential and small commercial users would be on the hook for only a fraction of the back debt big users say it is unfair to saddle them with all of edison s debt but supporters of the plan say it s these users that wanted deregulation and should shoulder the costs it created we re trying to put something together in a way that solves all these problems and if people are to be pigheaded about it we won t solve any problems said assemblyman fred keeley d boulder creek santa cruz county although the plan is an alternative to gov gray davis proposed deal to put edison back on its feet financially it could be used as a model to help restore pacific gas and electric co to solvency democrats say the plan contains some elements desired by republicans but gop lawmakers object to saddling large business users with edison s debt the plan is based on the way gas customers are divided into core and noncore users separating core users under this proposal electrical users would be divided the same way core users would be customers who use kilowatts or less a month noncore would be those using more than kilowatts out of edison s million customers only would be noncore customers but those customers use about percent of edison s demand for energy core customers would get their power from generators owned by edison long term contracts and alternative energy producers such as wind farms and solar panels on contract with the utility that would mean those customers would no longer be subject to the whims of the spot market which has far higher prices than other sources of electricity large users the noncore customers would be given the right to negotiate to buy their power directly from generators or build on site power plants to make themselves energy self sufficient the plan would be phased in through january to give large energy customers time to prepare for buying power on the open market during that period residential small business and large industrial users would all share in paying off edison s debt but in that burden would shift exclusively to the big users republican lawmakers and those same large users have been clamoring to be given what is called direct access to generators so they can negotiate cheaper rates enron is also backing the idea of cutting loose the largest electricity users because that would create a built in market for the energy the company sells large users who want to remain on the grid could do so edison encouraged sources said edison officials met with lawmakers over the weekend to iron out details of the plan a spokesman for edison said he was encouraged by the talks i haven t seen a finished product or a plan said bob foster a senior vice president with edison they re approaching this in a spirit of goodwill and trying to find a solution big businesses complain that the plan does not work because right now there is nowhere they can buy cheap electricity we re very concerned that separating the core from the noncore means we will experience extreme rate hikes over the next two years said d j smith a lobbyist for the california large energy consumers association when you add blackouts the multiple interruptions of production and another potentially huge rate hike the result would be catastrophic to the economy smith said added dorothy rothrock a lobbyist for the california manufacturers and technology association what s the rationale for the noncore to be paying the entire edison undercollection it sounds to me like just pure politics they don t want voters to pay because they vote consumer advocate smells a rat harvey rosenfield head of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights said he thought the plan would eventually turn into a bailout as business interests muscle lawmakers into pushing some portion of edison s debt onto residential and smaller commercial customers i think it s a trick we ve seen this same tactic used at the public utilities commission where what were supposed to be rate increases for big business end up costing more for residential and small businesses rosenfield said the new plan also does not include the outright purchase of edison s part of the transmission system that loops electricity around the state davis backs buying the lines for billion democrats have insisted that for the state s financial help taxpayers receive something of value republicans have insisted that they will back no proposal that includes state purchase of transmission lines in the new proposal the state would have a five year option to buy the transmission lines for billion the book value of the asset in addition the utility would make

ksl source world reporter tm asia intelligence wire more than per cent of the targeted government borrowings for the current year have been lifted from the market at pretty low yields over the last two months the reserve bank of india seems to have managed short term liquidity and interest rates to subserve the larger interest of making a success of the centre s borrowing programme over the last two years the government has been able to borrow cheap from the markets a facility denied to other parts of the economy that have to borrow at stiff lending rates from the banks banks credit rate borrowers and only the best get funds this is perfectly logical they also blindly put in funds into government floats as they are totally risk free which again is perfectly sensible perhaps in no part of the world is the practice of banking so risk free as in mera bharat mahan with banks carrying npas of well over rs crore the votaries of higher government spending should not crib as the centre s borrowing programmes have received a huge applause from the banking community and the centre promptly uses the funds on interest payments defence and subsidies with capital investment getting to be negative allowing the private sector greater latitude has not curbed the scope of public sector capital investment if it has not taken place it is because even the government is reluctant to set up power plants which have to offer free power to farmers that is precisely why the private parties are insisting on escrow accounts over the planning period public sector investment did not believe in cost benefit principles as neck high taxation levels and subsidies helped to hide the inefficiency that is not possible today in fact higher savings of the indian economy are being wasted more by the government than by anybody else also savings cannot be said to be acting as a restraint to the investment process in the urban sector there is an interest rate dichotomy with new delhi getting easier funds than the corporate world there is no premium on the interest rates for government inefficiency the same dichotomy prevails in the rural sector with bank funds flow tapering off and informal channels busy under indian conditions higher savings have nowhere to go making the cut in contractual savings look sensible it hurts not because interest rates are low but because there is no growth to absorb bank funds at this point of time one may not be able to find the tomes of any international economist to analyse the indian economy high savings nil growth steep government borrowings and

may he also said the company is currently not planning to terminate the ppa prior to the lapse of six months after the serving of the preliminary termination notice sources said that even though mseb is not purchasing power from dpc the company is not likely to default on its payments to lenders this is because dpc has some money left from the disbursements of the first phase of the project it can use the money to service its debt it can however not transfer the amount to the second phase without the lenders permission the company also has a sizable amount of completion equity over and above the base equity to bring in if it chooses to continue construction according to sources the indian lenders today wanted to know from enron whether it is actually willing to stay back and complete the project or walk away it appeared they are willing to stay but only without conceding too much top mseb officials said as far as mseb is concerned dpc power may be available but we would not take it we are not recognising the ppa any more they said the board had given the option to the company saying it would buy power and make payments according to the ppa but on an ad hoc basis the adjustments

bureau published july washington negotiations to settle a tangle of issues arising out of california s electricity debacle sputtered to an end monday with the sides light years apart on refunds for overpriced wholesale power sales the impasse raises the specter of years of litigation with a regulatory judge proposing a formula that could limit refunds to about billion while california is seeking at least billion and perhaps much more federal energy regulatory commission administrative judge curtis wagner said that within a week he ll urge the five ferc commissioners to begin fact finding hearings on how much is truly owed following guidelines he outlined sketchily monday among them would be limiting the time when refunds are allowed something that could reduce state claims by about one third and changing the way power plant costs are calculated to a formula more favored by generators gov gray davis said he was heartened by the judge s belief that california is due some amount of refund money rejecting the generators arguments for no refunds with the day negotiation session nearly moribund generators and power traders had offered up million in proposed refunds in the final days but wagner indicated that that would have to be offset by money the state still owes power companies meaning no cash would actually change hands the judge held out the possibility that at least two parties including san jose based calpine corp could reach separate agreements with the state from what i know it looks like we can reach an agreement calpine spokesman bill highlander confirmed monday but he said he could not disclose any details under wagner s gag order on participants in the negotiations enron corp one of the nation s highest profile power traders said california officials killed the talks by never budging from their claims that the state s consumers deserved at least billion in refunds for overcharges these talks never had a chance said enron spokesman mark palmer their political skins are worth more than million that the taxpayers of california could have used it was about creating and maintaining a tool for a witch hunt of the million compromise offer million was put on the table by what wagner called the big five generators reliant duke mirant williams and dynegy some of whom are under state investigation another million was offered by bc hydro british colombia s government utility which is not under ferc jurisdiction and million was offered by six california municipal utilities the sacramento municipal utility district the state s second largest municipal utility also declined to comment on the talks or any settlement amount it may have offered but said it would outline its position in writing thursday the judge s deadline for comments on his proposal consumer advocates and some industry officials said the judge s brief public remarks make it difficult to predict exactly what the impacts could be on the state s troubled electric scene if the judge is saying that the refund is topped at a billion that s outrageous said nettie hoge head of the utility reform network if they re going to start doing some fact finding hallelujah hoge said the talks had been unrealistic from the start because there was no effort by ferc to determine how high the overcharges had actually been and then work toward a compromise from there the state used a formula calculated by its nonprofit grid operator the independent system operator which was attacked by marketers as wildly high even while the state called it conservatively low joel newton representing all five of the big generators said monday that the iso has consistently based its demand on sketchy and incomplete data the face off between davis and power merchants began last fall as wholesale electricity costs were soaring and california utilities warned that they could be driven into bankruptcy the governor said generators and traders took advantage of the state s power shortage to manipulate markets and gouge consumers generators said they followed all laws and were only deriving fair profits in a scarcity situation ferc which entered the picture because by law it has to ensure that electricity rates are just and reasonable has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to craft a solution that could appease both sides state assembly speaker robert hertzberg d sherman oaks said monday that the failure of the settlement talks to agree on a refund figure comes as no surprise negotiators representing generators refused to even acknowledge the inescapable fact that they have profited enormously by exploiting a dysfunctional market at california s expense he said davis who had accused the generators of failing to negotiate in good faith with state representatives said that although ferc commissioners have been slow to respond to his requests for refunds and for price caps on wholesale electricity they now have the opportunity to redeem themselves he suggested the commissioners can opt to award california more than is recommended by the judge wagner after mediating talks that continued throughout the weekend seemed resigned to the fact that trying to bring more than government utility and power generating entities together proved to be an exercise in futility michael kahn head of the california delegation and consultant to the california iso nonetheless came away thinking the state had fared pretty well we came here wanting billion kahn said in all candor we didn t receive any meaningful settlement offers and so the negotiations were not as helpful as we had hoped they would be but our positions were vindicated because refunds were offered meanwhile pacific gas and electric co and southern california edison sounded the call for more talks we re willing to talk to anyone anytime about a settlement said steve pickett general counsel of southern california edison pg e said in a prepared statement that the sessions provide a solid basis for further negotiations how much money the state might eventually receive remains the big question mark wagner said settlement offers of million suggest that eventual refunds will amount to hundreds of millions of dollars maybe a billion but he also stressed that he would recommend no specific figure to ferc commissioners and does not know how big refunds might eventually be other recommendations wagner said he would make to the commission were a mixed bag for the state the judge said he would recommend refunds no further back than oct an action that kahn said would immediately slice billion off the state s refund analysis that stretched back to may but kahn said that was no defeat for the state which would turn to the courts to recover that and any other sums excluded from a final refund order we still have a viable litigation claim for the remainder kahn said brent bailey vice president and general counsel of duke energy of north america said he felt the formula laid out by wagner would generate a refund order in the range of billion to billion it s a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks bailey said the bee s david whitney can be reached at or dwhitney

california s energy crisis heralded by davis as part of a powerful one two three punch that will bring california closer to energy independence the los medanos energy center in pittsburg spit out no more than megawatts on its opening day they said that is less than percent of the plant s megawatt operating capacity los medanos could generate a couple of hundred megawatts later this week but is not expected to reach its full output for two to three weeks according to knowledgable sources representatives for calpine and the governor s office when pressed for details acknowledged that the plant was not running at full tilt but said they did not know how much electricity was actually produced monday calpine which will bill someone for whatever electricity it sells from los medanos is keeping track of the production but the figure wasn t immediately available for the media spokeswoman katherine potter said even if it was two megawatts that s two more megawatts that we didn t have yesterday said davis spokesman steve maviglio he said the opening was largely ceremonial timed for the convenience of the governor and calpine s top executive but consumer advocate harvey rosenfield called the media event a deception it was the third highly publicized power plant launch the governor has attended in the past two weeks it s the governor trying to convince people he s hard at work solving the problem when it s all for show rosenfield said he s governing by sound bite he s certainly getting his money s worth from the consultants he hired davis political adviser garry south said last week that the governor s new radio ad campaign will highlight the efforts to produce more power in california generation comes up in our polls as being the no thing people want us to do build

mirant corp billion the federal government s bonne ville power administration million and the sacramento municipal utility district million generally the more desperate the state was for power the higher the prices for instance oklahoma based generator williams cos commanded a megawatt hour march when blackouts struck more than million californians location also was critical on march the state paid the pg e trading unit but only to arizona based pinnacle west capital corp the difference was that pg e s power was delivered to energy starved northern california while pinnacle s was sent to southern california where energy wasn t so scarce split second timing was also crucial at a m feb the state paid to mirant for power to be delivered the next day by a m it was paying mieco inc a long beach trading firm for the same product that s the spot market it s the most volatile market in the world and it changes on a second by second basis said enron corp spokesman mark palmer for all the criticism leveled at duke reliant and other big corporations government owned entities were among the most aggressive at charging high prices bc hydro the electric utility owned by the canadian province of british columbia submitted bills for up to a megawatt hour the city of glendale charged a megawatt hour for power in january while smud charged a megawatt hour in march the city of eugene ore averaged a megawatt hour in february we play by the rules of the electricity trade marketplace said bc hydro spokesman wayne cousins our traders worked very hard to find additional sources of electricity to keep the lights on in california had we not come through and stepped forward with these supplies the consequences to california customers would have been severe the state also said it

creative to cut costs by cheryl miller bee correspondent published july to matt muniz the solar panels sprouting on the rooftop of the santa rita jail in dublin aren t just energy makers they re money in the bank when all panels are completely installed this month the kilowatt photovoltaic system the largest rooftop project ever constructed in the united states will cut the jail s demand on the electric grid by up to percent according to muniz alameda county s energy program manager that sun power combined with conservation projects already completed at the jail will slash about a year from the facility s energy bill muniz is already scouting other county rooftops for solar potential with the cost of electricity going up you can start looking at it as a business decision just investing your money said muniz there s virtually no maintenance on this equipment it just sits on your roof and converts right into electricity that you re using as soon as you generate it i think solar is the wave of the future even though it s been around or years the santa rita jail project is among the largest and perhaps most conspicuous examples of steps government agencies are taking to cut electricity use in response to skyrocketing power bills and gov gray davis call for public entities to conserve among the examples san francisco leaders are pondering a bond measure to finance solar powered rooftop projects around the city the tulare county town of lindsay will open city hall two hours earlier at a m and close at p m monday through thursday this summer so offices can stay dark all day friday and during peak use afternoon hours sacramento county has instituted a casual dress policy so employees can better withstand office temperatures that climb as high as degrees workers have also set sprinklers to run at night so that electric water pumps operate during low demand when you start to see the bills going up and you start to hear concerns from some citizens that obviously raises the threshold of wanting to help out said jolena voorhis an energy analyst at the california state association of counties certainly counties stepped up to the plate when they were asked to increase conservation efforts they ve done about as much as humanly possible kings county leaders thought they made a great deal in when they signed up for southern california edison s interruptible load program which promises customers lower rates in exchange for agreeing to shut down electrical services in times of shortage then california s power crisis hit full force this year since january edison has called on the central valley county to cut electricity at its hanford government center times for up to six hours each cycle at times that meant no lights to greet the public no computers to process food stamp requests and during the valley s foggy winter days no heat to warm many of the employees we had one week in january when we were virtually shut down said chief administrative officer larry spikes we just decided we couldn t function that way so kings county supervisors bought a diesel powered generator to match those already at the jail and juvenile center they also decided to open and close administrative offices one hour earlier this summer so buildings can power down before high demand hits the grid around p m the new hours dimmed hallways and moments of darkness that occur when the generators kick on have become a routine part of doing government business these days spikes said so far most counties have been able to absorb higher energy costs without cutting into programs because of relatively healthy budgets in recent years voorhis said public agencies power troubles have proved a boon to some businesses revenues at powerlight the berkeley company that installed the santa rita jail photovoltaic system have tripled since last year the last six months have been particularly intense said janice lin director of business development for powerlight in some ways the energy crisis in california has been a call to action the sacramento municipal utility district which already boasts the largest photovoltaic program in the country has a customer waiting list for solar projects and plans to bring sun power to the state capitol said don osborn smud s solar program manager back in dublin the inmates at the santa rita jail still receive three meals air conditioning and hot showers powered now in part by the plentiful sun in this relatively fog free part of the east bay the million project financed entirely with state and utility subsidies should generate enough savings to pay for itself within the decade muniz said it s a good investment for the money we re putting up front he said energy talks reach no settlement state threatens suit by mark sherman associated press july washington with talks between the state and power generators stalled california may go to court to help win the billion state officials believe it was overcharged for electricity i think we have demonstrated very clearly both to the ferc and to the judge that the state is owed billion and will settle for nothing less said roger salazar a spokesman for gov gray davis with negotiations at an impasse the administrative law judge for the federal energy regulatory commission said california is probably owed no more than billion in refunds the numbers were too far apart said curtis wagner the ferc chief administrative law judge california wagner said may receive nothing at all because generators may be owed more than they have to return for any overcharges he placed the refunds owed the state at between million and billion power providers had offered million as part of an overall settlement while california state officials sought billion wagner said he said california officials had not made the case for billion in refunds salazar however said the state would go to court and may ask for billion separately wagner split off claims of overcharges from the pacific northwest saying he has not had time to consider those allegations under the short timetable ordered by ferc last month wagner served as a mediator during the days of negotiations and will recommend a settlement to ferc by next monday the commission ordered the talks last month in an effort to resolve differences between producers and the state over the breakdown of california s deregulated electricity market consumer advocates assailed the judge s recommendation and urged the state to continue its attempt to get refunds from what they say are profiteering power companies it s like catching a bank robber but instead of making him give back all of it you only make him give back percent of what he stole said douglas heller spokesman for the santa monica based foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights power generators however were generally pleased with wagner s comments brent bailey general counsel for duke energy said even if the formula wagner recommends produces billion in refunds that s a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks california officials negotiating on behalf of utilities the public utilities commission and state power buyers accused the producers of manipulating supply to unfairly drive up prices the producers have acknowledged prices are high but blame jumps in the price of natural gas which fuels many power plants and the workings of the free market the bill for wholesale power in california soared to billion last year from billion the year before davis has estimated the state could spend as much as billion this year the producers reiterated monday that california s numbers are grossly inflated attorneys for the five major generators duke energy dynegy mirant reliant energy and the williams cos said in a statement that they have made a very substantial global settlement offer reliant would agree to no more than million in refunds as part of an overall settlement that also would have to include protection from additional legal claims said john h stout a company senior vice president but stout also said reliant s fundamental position has been and remains that no refunds are justified refunds in jeopardy as talks fail judge sees possibility of offsets equal to the billions sought by state by toby eckert copley news service july washington settlement talks between california and power providers accused of electricity price gouging collapsed yesterday and the judge who will now hand the case over to federal regulators set a course far from favorable to the state s demand for billion in refunds there are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a billion dollars curtis l wagner jr chief administrative law judge for the federal energy regulatory commission said in previewing the recommendations he will make to the commission but wagner who mediated the talks also suggested that power sellers are still owed sums for electricity that probably are higher than any overcharges for which they may have to pay refunds that opened the possibility that california could see no cash refunds only a reduction in the billions of dollars the power generators and marketers claim they are owed by state entities and utilities wagner said he would recommend that ferc hold a fast track hearing to try to untangle the complex financial claims and counterclaims arising from california s power crisis wagner also outlined a method that he said ferc should use for calculating refunds while his proposed formula includes part of one method the state used it contains several elements for calculating electricity costs that were favored by power sellers who maintain that california s numbers are wildly exaggerated i would suspect that would result in a number much below billion said joe ronan vice president of calpine a san jose based electricity generator i think wagner s method reflects more accurately what actually happened in the state s dysfunctional power market but michael kahn the state s lead negotiator said wagner vindicated california s core arguments the hundreds of people who came here on the other side had argued to the mediator that there should not be any refunds and that position was loudly rejected said kahn chairman of the organization that manages most of california s power grid we think the numbers even using the judge s formula are going to be in the multiple billions whatever amount of money is awarded to us we will have viable claims in state court and other jurisdictions for the remainder so what we have here is a situation where california will get its billion power sellers acknowledged that the threat of litigation remains worrisome to them they sought an end to investigations of their conduct and immunity from legal action as part of their bargaining position during two weeks of negotiations ordered by ferc the two sides came nowhere near bridging their differences wagner said a number of power sellers had put forward offers that totaled million that s a long way from splitting the difference he said in days you can t work miracles yesterday the deadline for completing the talks the ill will between the two sides broke into the open as wagner allowed reporters into the previously closed hearings each side essentially accused the other of bargaining in bad faith and failing to put forward realistic proposals john h stout a senior vice president at reliant energy wholesale group said the state used biased calculations to arrive at its billion refund demand he also said that reliant offered to knock million off the million it claims it is still owed for power sold into the state kahn shot back that reliant made the offer confidentially to wagner and never approached the state figures scrutinized this is the first time we ve heard any of this information and to give the impression that somehow there s been cooperation or forthcomingness i think is misleading kahn said the state s refund calculations were scrutinized repeatedly during the talks the billion figure emerged from a study by the california power grid operator of charges for electricity between may and may a period when wholesale power prices soared kahn said the figure was essentially duplicated when the state went back and calculated what power costs would have been if a pricing method instituted by ferc last month had been in effect for the entire yearlong period ferc ordered the pricing method in a bid to tame wholesale prices in the west in a partial win for the state wagner said he would recommend that ferc use the order retroactively as a basis for calculating refunds an approach resisted by the power sellers but he said that ferc should only scrutinize charges going back to october and should make several key changes in how power generating costs are calculated for instance he said ferc should determine the actual amount of gas heat it takes to generate a megawatt of electricity and use spot market prices in northern and southern california to determine the cost of gas rather than a statewide average cost computed monthly fewer overcharges those and other parts of the complex formula wagner will recommend could increase the benchmark cost of producing power and drive down the amount of overcharges kahn said that applying ferc s pricing method only back to october would put about billion of the state s refund claim off limits brent bailey vice president and general counsel for duke energy north america said we think wagner s modifications are certainly a vast improvement over ferc s june order and also certainly over the state s model america in sacramento gov gray davis issued a statement characterizing the electricity suppliers as pirates who refused to negotiate in good faith while in the past the ferc has shown little if any interest in consumers they now have the opportunity to redeem themselves by returning the billion california has demonstrated it is owed davis said despite the harsh rhetoric both sides indicated that they would continue trying to reach one on one

no refunds from wholesalers wagner said power generators had offered million in refunds the state has asked for billion since may wagner said he will not recommend refunds for power sales that

far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by gov gray davis who has aggressively blamed a handful of texas companies state records show during the first three months of this year one of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisis an assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to texas firms according to documents released to the times on monday by the department of water resources which now buys power for california among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatt hour were a canadian public utility a subsidiary of san diego gas electric s parent company and the los angeles department of water and power the report shows their average prices ranged from a megawatt hour charged by powerex the trading arm of british columbia s bc hydro to an hour by the dwp in fact some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by davis and other state officials dynegy inc duke energy and mirant charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period those companies average prices ranged from to per megawatt hour according to an analysis of the documents the figures cover the various types of spot and longer term power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razor thin reserves leading to continuous power emergencies davis spokesman steve maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private out of state generators because in general they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period you have to look at the whole picture maviglio said the governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats he said their profits were to above last year just because there are other entities who are charging us more per megawatt hour doesn t change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from houston tulsa atlanta or charlotte the report by the department of water resources was provided to the times on the same day the state released pages of documents on california s electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year s first quarter the records detail how the state spent nearly billion buying power in the first five months of the year and underscore the complexity of the state s energy problem they also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators oscar hidalgo a spokesman for the water resources agency said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year all the prices were high he said noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in mid january the average price per megawatt hour for all state purchases went from in january to in may spot prices fell from an average of per hour to the reports show in the first quarter of the year some public entities prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies for example houston based enron one of the nation s biggest power traders charged an average of per megawatt hour and atlanta based mirant which sold the most to the state a total of million charged an average of per megawatt hour by contrast a calgary canada firm transalta energy averaged a megawatt hour and the sacramento municipal utility district had average charges of per megawatt hour a spokesman for enron mark palmer said recently that the vilification of enron was based on politics not facts spokesmen for bc hydro could not be reached late monday to comment on its huge sales to the state in the past the utility has defended its pricing practices saying it has offered last minute hydroelectric power that helped keep california s lights on a spokeswoman for sempra the parent company of san diego gas electric said late monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state officials at dwp who could not be reached monday evening have defended their pricing saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high more power bought than projected hidalgo of the department of water resources said his agency s efforts coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices have begun to tame the state s market still the state had to purchase million in power in april and may about more than davis analysts had projected hidlago said that was because of hot weather in may and other supply problems in april he said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in june and early july the reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in june and july partly because spot prices have fallen sharply often to well under a megawatt hour a summary department of water resources report released monday credited davis program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long term power contracts with with moving the california electric energy industry closer to normalcy copyright los angeles times duke energy asked to allow release of data power senator says the generator is refusing to make public some information crucial to the price gouging probe firm says it s complying carl ingram times staff writer july sacramento the chairman of a senate committee probing suspected price gouging during the california energy crisis charged monday that duke energy is refusing to allow him to make public information key to his investigation sen joe dunn d santa ana said duke has made the price bidding information from its chula vista plant available to committee members and staffers but under a federal confidentiality rule the data cannot be made public without duke s consent the documents concern the chula vista plant which former employees have alleged was ramped up and down to drive up power prices during three days in january however state records show that the agency overseeing the electricity grid ordered those gyrations to keep the power flowing throughout the state dunn said duke s refusal thwarts the committee s investigation and efforts to enact possible remedial legislation because the confidential information cannot be shared with others in the legislature or the public dunn said duke cited a rule of the federal energy regulatory commission that gives the company the authority to decide which records it makes public and which stay secret the only one who can release the data is duke we agreed to be bound by what is provided in the ferc tariff nothing more or less he said former employees tell of maneuvers dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to obtain the information elsewhere and release it over duke s objections three former workers at the duke plant near chula vista testified last month under oath that the plant among other things was ramped up and down in what seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the jan emergency but duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the california independent system operator which keeps the state s electricity grid in balance duke later provided cal iso documents backing up its explanation duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to provide a full picture of the plant s operation during the three days but dunn chairman of the select senate committee on alleged price gouging said monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed data duke was guilty of the same tactics duke is trying to draw the impression that it has provided the full picture but they are fully aware that we cannot draw any final conclusions until all that data has been released that hasn t occurred dunn said to make a determination whether the chula vista power was withheld to drive up prices dunn said the committee must publicly examine the bids duke submitted from which the iso issued orders to the plant they include the expensive hour ahead and day ahead markets he said duke a north carolina based wholesaler that operates several plants in california noted that it considers the information proprietary and off limits to legislators not on the committee duke spokesman tom williams insisted that the generator is attempting to comply with the committee s demands but he was unable to say whether duke would agree to make the bidding documents public along with other records the committee plans to turn over we are complying now williams said there is some suggestion that we are leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify i don t know what we are ultimately going to do the committee had threatened to cite eight wholesale generators unless they provide pricing and bidding documents by wednesday six including duke have said they would comply to avoid a contempt citation two enron and mirant were cited dunn said the committee on wednesday likely will give companies that are trying to comply an extra week to do so but others probably will be formally charged with contempt in a report to the full senate the upper house is the final arbiter of such issues although there is scant precedent for levying penalties against those cited for contempt dunn said he favors imposing severe fines in the most recent case a cement company executive was sent to jail copyright los angeles times news analysis concern over price of long term power pacts grows embedded costs may yield more rate hikes critics say and the billion total could complicate plans to rescue edison dan morain times staff writer july sacramento even as the summer progresses without blackouts and gov gray davis prepares for yet another news conference today to symbolically switch on a new power plant the work in the capitol has shifted to the seemingly more daunting task of balancing the books it s a task with potentially far more long lasting implications for state coffers for businesses bottom lines and for consumers wallets in particular long term power contracts trumpeted by the governor s office as helping to bring stability to california s out of control electricity market are having the opposite effect politically a growing concern about the billion price tag of the contracts is complicating one of davis most ambitious energy initiatives a proposed financial rescue of southern california edison which already faces an uncertain fate in the legislature questions about the contracts come as california readies a complex billion bond sale to reimburse the state s general fund for other power purchases critics worry that costs embedded in the contracts on top of the billions needed to pay for the edison rescue could lead to additional electricity rate hikes for consumers key lawmakers consumer advocates and business lobbyists are urging that at least some of the pacts be renegotiated citing a recent plunge in wholesale energy costs these critics say the state should work to shorten the duration of the contracts and lower some of the prices they argue that the state entered into the deals under duress after california s utilities neared insolvency and the state department of water resources took over the purchasing of electricity for more than million residents they are vulnerable senate energy committee chairwoman debra bowen d marina del rey said of deals the state struck with independent power companies when prices were at record highs bowen lauds davis administration negotiators for signing the best deals they could but she said that in the crisis atmosphere in which the negotiations took place the state had two cards and the generators had contracts open to challenges the contracts could be challenged in court or more immediately before the federal energy regulatory commission in washington there an administrative law judge could direct that the pacts be reworked as part of a settlement of allegations by davis that generators overcharged the state for electricity by billion we ought not to say fine the contracts were the best we could do bowen said for his part davis says he is willing to accept partial payment of the billion in the form of contracts with terms more favorable to the state he attributes the recent sharp drop in wholesale electricity prices to conservation the administration s effort to increase power supply and a major factor the long term contracts which slashed the state s reliance on the volatile daily or spot market you can see the value of these long term contracts dramatically shrinking our overall price which is what matters to californians davis said pointing out that the average cost of power plunged from may to june davis energy advisor s david freeman who helped negotiate the contracts said they may end up costing less than billion given the recent decline in prices for natural gas the main fuel for california s electricity generating plants freeman also compared critics to someone who calls the fire department to douse a blaze after the fire is out he said you complain about the water damage the contracts have other defenders among them uc berkeley economics professor severin borenstein who says the deals helped to tame the volatile spot market by reducing generators incentive to drive up prices while reducing the state s exposure to wild swings in price the point of signing long term contracts is not to get a great price it s to reduce risk borenstein said still experts have been picking through the pacts ever since a superior court judge in san diego ruling in a california public records act lawsuit by news organizations and republican lawmakers ordered last month that davis unseal the contracts an analysis done for the assembly by three experts one each representing southern california edison the utility reform network a consumer group and large electricity consumers concluded that the about billion price tag announced by the administration may not account for all the costs when other expenses are factored in ranging from environmental equipment upgrades to any new energy related taxes the contracts could cost an additional to once the contracts were made public senate republican leader jim brulte of rancho cucamonga said just about anyone who can read began calling for those contracts to be renegotiated as buyers remorse spreads through the capitol the contracts increasingly are seen as a hurdle or a bargaining chip as davis and lawmakers confront fast approaching deadlines in their effort to prevent the energy crisis from morphing into a broader financial crisis a bill pushed by davis to avert bankruptcy for the financially hobbled southern california edison must be approved by aug the deadline could be tighter because the legislature is scheduled to adjourn for a monthlong break july davis rescue plan along with legislative alternatives languishes in the legislature the plan which has little apparent support would require the state to buy edison s system of transmission lines for billion and permit the utility to charge ratepayers for the rest of its back debt of billion some lobbyists and lawmakers believe that the electricity rate hike approved in march by the california public utilities commission at cents a kilowatt hour the largest in state history may not be enough the revenue generated under the new rate structure must cover the costs of the long term power contracts and repay the planned billion in bonds which would be the largest municipal deal ever whether there would be sufficient money left to pay for the edison rescue remains to be seen but some experts say the utility may need to seek a separate rate hike to cover its costs as written the contracts have few escape clauses davis cannot simply walk away from them if he concludes that prices are too high still criticism persists and crosses political lines harry snyder longtime sacramento lobbyist for consumers union and jack stewart president of the california manufacturers and technology assn rarely find themselves on the same side of a debate but in separate interviews they sounded similar themes if there is a way to buy our way out of these contracts even if we have to pay damages we d be better off in the long run snyder said stewart like other business leaders does not advocate abrogating the contracts but like many familiar with the terms he hopes that some deals can be renegotiated they are problematic he said in a move that critics fear could lock in high electricity prices for the next decade the davis administration is pushing the puc to agree within a month to limit its authority to question costs incurred by the department of water resources as it goes about procuring power state treasurer phil angelides said the puc must act so he can complete the billion bond sale a binding agreement is necessary so that wall street investors can be assured that they will be repaid the state will be out of cash by the end of the year without the bond sale he said we will move toward fiscal insolvency the so called rate agreement a draft of which was obtained by the times would bind customers of the three big regulated utilities to pay more than just the principal and interest on the billion in bonds consumers would have to pay for consultants lawyers to pay taxes fees and other as yet undefined charges that may be incurred by the department of water resources additionally the puc would be obligated to approve payments for programs by which the state would pay large and small customers to cut electricity use although the legislature has not approved the programs and their details remain to be worked out the department of water resources estimates the cost to be million spread over this year and next it is loaded up senate president pro tem john burton d san francisco said of the proposed rate deal adding that it would require the commission to raise rates to cover whatever the department of water resources decides to do that is giving a blank check to some bureaucratic office he said dictatorial power warning stewart of the manufacturers group also is alarmed by the plan saying it would provide the water agency with dictatorial power as skeptical as we are of the puc process at least there is a process stewart said referring to the commission s procedures to set electricity rates there is no process for dwr dwr just tells the puc this is what we need and the puc must approve it others say the rate agreement is a standard piece of work given the extraordinary step the legislature took in january when it authorized the department of water resources to buy power for utilities that had fallen so deeply into debt that they could no longer carry out their obligation to consumers in essence davis energy advisor freeman said lawmakers in january created the equivalent of a public power purchasing agency beyond the jurisdiction of the puc there is no public power agency in california that is reviewed by the puc said freeman former head of the los angeles department of water and power times staff writer nancy

chronicle staff writers tuesday july san francisco chronicle url washington an administrative law judge delivering a powerful message to gov gray davis and california energy officials cast aside the state s claim that it is owed billion in electricity overcharges by generators and called for further hearings to determine hard numbers the judge ending talks designed to settle the dispute between california and power sellers said the state and its cash strapped utilities may owe more in unpaid electricity bills than they are owed for overcharges by the generators the comments by federal energy regulatory commission chief administrative law judge curtis l wagner although a strong endorsement of the generators position seemed to indicate that neither side wanted to settle the issue before it reached the five member regulatory commission there are refunds due to california that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a billion dollars wagner said yesterday at the same time there are sums due to sellers from the california independent system operator and the investor owned utilities in the state of california that probably are higher than any overcharges that the state may come up with now it will be up to the federal regulators to settle the case but the recommendations by wagner who mediated the talks carry significant weight with the commission and cast doubt on the state s chances of collecting the full billion it claims to be owed the judge said he will recommend that the commission order new hearings to calculate what the state and the power sellers are each owed the hearings would be overseen by an administrative law judge and would last to days wagner said closing session wagner made his comments in the closing session of the day talks which were ordered last month by the regulatory commission to try to defuse the dispute between power wholesalers and california officials before it reached the courts the judge s message was a sharp rebuke to the unyielding stand by california leaders especially davis who last week said he wouldn t take a dime less than billion for california s consumers the governor issued a statement shortly after the close of talks insisting that california had won its basic case that the state is owed refunds i am pleased that judge wagner accepted our methodology for calculating refunds and rejected the generators position that no refunds are due davis said the governor s chief representative at the talks michael kahn called the judge s statement a ringing endorsement of the state s call for refunds kahn said the judge s order would improve the state s legal position if it files suit against power sellers generators favored but much of the judge s order seemed to favor the generators for example state officials have made the case they should be refunded billion for alleged overcharges from may to may even though the regulatory commission has said only that the period starting oct could be considered the judge said yesterday that he would stick with the october date meaning that more than a third of the state s claim at least billion would not be refunded by the commission brent bailey vice president and general counsel of duke energy north america said that under wagner s guidelines the state may be eligible for billion to billion certainly to the extent that it helped refute what california has been saying it s a victory bailey said of the judge s statement but davis said the nation s big power sellers never came to the table with a serious offer not surprisingly the energy pirates that bilked ratepayers out of billions of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good faith davis said million offer wagner disclosed yesterday that the generators had made an offer to california million in refunds the judge said the figure included about million from the so called big five generators as well as million from bc hydro s powerex million by a group of electricity marketers million by six california municipal utilities and million offered by other out of state power sellers california officials say it was not a legitimate offer because it included no cash it was simply an agreement by the companies to wipe some of the state s debt off the books throughout the talks generators complained that the california team was trying to shield some california companies and government power providers from having to pay any refunds and trying to disproportionately extract sums from out of state power companies favoritism charged according to documents and interviews the state attempted to remove pacific gas and electric co southern california edison san diego gas electric the los angeles department of water and power and other government power suppliers from the group from which it was asking for refunds even though they were paid the same high rates for power as everyone else representatives for the power sellers said they believe that davis made a political decision to demagogue the companies while refusing to compromise on the state s claims they say the governor calculated that his reputation would be enhanced by continuing to attack the generators the california delegation did not come into these talks with any willingness to compromise said mark stultz vice president of the electric power supply association a washington d c trade group they went in with a dollar figure and never budged on that figure if you re looking for a settlement you have to be willing to compromise up next the federal energy regulatory commission will consider probably on july new hearings on how much if anything california was overcharged if ordered by the commission an administrative law judge will take testimony on how much the state says it was overcharged and how much generators say they are owed regulators will rule based on the judge s recommendation if the parties disagree they can go to court e mail the writers at zcoile

san jose based calpine as a sort of energy favorite son they were the first to enter long term contracts with us the governor said calpine is among the big energy firms being pressed by the state to issue refunds for what the governor insists were overcharges but unlike the others davis said calpine is giving ground in negotiations they likely will be the first to enter into settlements with us he said although the los medanos plant is one of a generation of efficient new gas fired plants that will be as much as percent cheaper to run than their forebears the state will be paying well above current market rates for the first three months of its contract with calpine calpine president peter cartwright insisted however that the company is not making excess profits off the deal to ensure that calpine could provide the electricity even if plant construction wasn t finished by its mid july target date the company bought the needed power from other energy traders at a megawatt hour when market rates were higher he said in addition to the megawatts it has pledged to the state calpine will supply electricity to the sacramento municipal utility district and other power agencies in the long term calpine will be selling power to california at a megawatt hour cartwright said a spokesman for the state department of water resources which started buying power in january after state utilities buckled under high prices said calpine s rate is well below the a megawatt hour the state is aiming for as an average price for the long term contracts cartwright said that with its recently

hazardous materials director lew pascalli said that there is always a possibility that a plant s hydraulic or mechanical systems could fail but that those chances are slight given the growing number of power plants coming online and the state s successful conservation effort he also said industry has done a good job preparing for outages the industry is doing a good faith effort in this particular instance to make sure that nothing happens pascalli said county officials relied on industry records in determining the adequacy of the different plans such as having multiple electrical

the facilities include chemical plants oil refineries and small shops that produce limited amounts of hazardous materials for many of these businesses the loss of power would shut down their

p m pdt monday july by jim puzzanghera mercury news washington bureau washington california officials and power suppliers failed to agree on refunds for electricity overcharges as days of contentious negotiations ended monday leaving the matter in the hands of a federal judge who said the state is owed much less than the billion it demands the judge overseeing the talks for the federal energy regulatory commission put the refunds at between several hundred million dollars and a billion dollars his estimate is closer to the million offer made by power suppliers during negotiations the offer was rejected by california officials but it was unclear monday which side in the bitter refund battle would prevail and california officials indicated the dispute is probably headed to court at stake is how much the state s electricity consumers will ultimately have to pay for costs that skyrocketed as california s deregulation system collapsed curtis wagner the commission s chief administrative law judge will recommend a formula for the commission to use to calculate a refund dating back to october that formula a complex methodology that involves factors such as daily natural gas prices includes many of the provisions the energy suppliers had advocated during the talks michael kahn who headed the california negotiating team said the state would contest some aspects of the formula but even without changes kahn said he was confident the formula will result in more refunds than wagner estimated we think the numbers even using the judge s formula are going to be in the multiple billions said kahn chairman of the state independent system operator which runs the electricity grid california will get its billion dollars if we don t get all of it from the commission we ll still get the remainder of the money through the courts amount in dispute power industry representatives appeared pleased with the judge s plan we haven t gone and run the full numbers but it s going to be nowhere near the billion said brent bailey vice president and general counsel for duke energy north america but let s face it that s a pie in the sky number that nobody in there believed in their right mind was a legitimate number wagner acknowledged he had not calculated any figures using his formula saying he arrived at his dollar estimate based on the offers made by the suppliers the energy commission ordered the private settlement conference last month when it enacted new price controls to try to rein in soaring electricity prices in california and throughout the west commissioners hoped that under pressure of a deadline and their looming intervention the state and the power suppliers could resolve the refund issue and stave off future litigation but the suppliers and state officials never came close to a deal participants said the numbers were too far apart you saw billion on one end and you saw million on the other end and that s a long way to splitting the difference wagner said i think a lot of the parties genuinely wanted to settle others didn t wagner now has until monday to make his recommendation to the five member commission which will make the final ruling on refunds to date the commission has ordered million in refunds for periods since last oct wagner said monday that he will ask that a special hearing be set up in the next days to get the detailed information from the state and power suppliers needed to determine a refund total using his formula the state may not end up with any cash as any refund total could be applied to the several billion dollars california and its utilities still owe many of the power suppliers reflecting the tone of the negotiations california gov gray davis on monday blamed power suppliers for the failure of the talks and challenged the commission to resolve the situation not surprisingly the energy pirates that bilked ratepayers out of billions of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good faith with our team in washington d c davis said while in the past the ferc has shown little if any interest in consumers they now have the opportunity to redeem themselves by returning the billion california has demonstrated it is owed davis may go to court at the opening of a new power plant in contra costa county on monday davis told reporters that he s prepared to take the power generators to court if ferc doesn t order the full refund davis also said the iso s estimate of billion doesn t represent all the overcharges he said other estimates put the figure as high as billion although he did not elaborate about how those figures were calculated john h stout senior vice president for reliant energy wholesale group said the state used faulty methodology to arrive at the billion figure california officials and several suppliers said they would continue to negotiate separately and an official with san jose based calpine said his company is close to a settlement with the state power suppliers urged wagner not to calculate refunds by applying the energy commissions june price limits plan retroactively but that s what wagner said he will do it was a victory for california officials who had pushed for it wagner however also made some changes to the price limit plan that power suppliers had wanted he applied it only back to oct state officials wanted it to cover up to may billion difference the state s billion figure comes from may through may factoring refunds beginning with oct eliminates about billion in overcharges the state says occurred in the earlier period among the changes to the commission s formula that wagner made was to revise the way the prevailing electricity price limit is calculated wagner wants the price limit determined for each hour of each day the commission s formula sets a price limit during stage one power emergencies that remains in effect until the next emergency but in a sign of just how complex the issue is stanford university economist frank wolak said he believes the standards described by the judge will produce a much higher figure than billion that s the methodology the state used said wolak who advises the california iso on

nissenbaum mercury news sacramento bureau sacramento six months after jumping into the electricity business the davis administration on monday provided the first detailed glimpse of california s daily power purchases showing more than billion in payments much of it to government owned utilities and private companies that state officials have branded as price gougers the state spent an additional billion on a variety of contracts and other electricity services designed to stabilize the volatile energy markets according to documents that the state agreed to release last week amid a legal dispute over public access to the data in roughly the first five months of the year the state shelled out billion to atlanta based mirant the most any company was paid for electricity followed by billion to powerex the marketing arm of bc hydro in british columbia it also paid million to the los angeles department of water and power the documents raise questions about some of the common assumptions that have arisen around the electricity crisis for instance almost percent of the state s purchases have come from government run power generators in california and elsewhere but not texas some of the biggest suppliers are from the northwest gov gray davis who has ambitions to run for the white house has put much of the blame for the soaring costs of power on energy companies based in president bush s home state the figures are tucked inside of pages of invoices that davis has resisted divulging saying disclosure would encourage suppliers to charge more the state which last month released information on its long term electricity contracts worth billion agreed thursday to release the first quarter details short on explanation the figures were disclosed late monday by the california department of water resources which buys power for the state s financially strapped major utilities and seem to buttress the administration s contention that the price of power is gradually dropping but offer little or no explanation for what prompted the decrease in january for instance the average price for power on the spot market was a megawatt hour it peaked in april at and dropped to in may one megawatt powers about homes davis spokesman steve maviglio said the price data supports the governor s assertions that california has been gouged the bad guys are clearly the out of state generators maviglio said there has been a significant shift of money out of california but the documents fail to shed much light on whether as the administration contends the price drop was due to long term power contracts negotiated by the state earlier this year critics contend that the davis administration panicked and rushed into deals that commit the state to pay high prices for many years used for support republican officials used the price information to bolster their attacks against davis a democrat for signing long term contracts with power generators even as the price of power on the spot market was coming down partly because of the declining price of natural gas used to fuel many plants it s more clear than ever that the long term contracts are a bad deal said assemblyman tony strickland r camarillo the governor s really hurt the ratepayers for the next five or years the newly released bills highlight the volatility of california s energy market where the price per megawatt hour ranged from to on any given day the records show the prices from seller to seller varied widely with some of the highest prices being charged by public utilities and companies outside texas on one day in february for example san diego based sempra energy was charging per megawatt hour the eugene water and electric board was charging nearly and duke energy a north carolina company was charging up to the state s daily spending peaked may at million for all power including the spot market and contracted power the state began buying power in mid january on behalf of the state s major utilities which were unable to borrow money to buy power after amassing enormous debts for electricity san jose based calpine corp which is building several new power plants around california including one in south san jose did only million worth of business with the state in the first five months of the year according to the figures the state began buying power in mid january when pacific gas electric co and southern california edison co were on the ropes financially pg e later went into bankruptcy on monday state lawmakers took another shot at trying to cobble together a plan to rescue financially ailing edison while most concede that a rescue plan davis worked out with edison will not win the necessary support in the legislature lawmakers have created several working groups to come up with alternatives compromise plan on monday state sen byron sher d redwood city unveiled the latest compromise proposal that seeks to protect average ratepayers and small businesses from further rate increases and forces everyone else to help finance the edison bailout the shared pain proposal would force power producers owed about billion to take a percent haircut and agree to forgive about million in edison debts edison would be asked to swallow billion about a third of its debt and big users would be asked to pay off the remaining billion in debts possibly by paying higher prices for power in exchange large companies would be given the opportunity to buy power on the open market a system that would allow many of them to sign cheap energy deals sher presented the

dims talks break down judge says state is owed much less than its billion demand and unpaid bills may offset gains july by dena bunis and john howard the orange county register washington the nation s chief energy judge said monday that california is owed maybe billion in refunds from power generators a fraction of the billion demanded by gov gray davis and even at that said judge curtis wagner the electricity sellers are owed so much more in unpaid power bills that in the end california might not see one red cent wagner announced his recommendation to the federal energy regulatory commission after two weeks of fruitless negotiations between all the parties to california s electricity crisis with no settlement the matter is now in the commissioners hands power generators wagner said had offered a combined million in refunds an offer the state rejected i don t think it s billion dollars he said afterwards because i haven t been shown that it was for california consumers every dollar the state can extract in refunds is a dollar less that ratepayers have to shell out for state purchased power and the more money the state gets back the better the chances of warding off future rate increases california will get its billion insisted michael kahn head of the state s delegation and the california independent system operator kahn brushed off wagner s comments finding victory in the judge s assertion that the state is owed some refunds a concept the generators have been unwilling to embrace up to now he said since the talks began some generators have made refund offers last week duke energy offered million and on monday reliant officials revealed their refund offer was million provided all other actions against the company were dropped but the net result of the day closed door sessions is that california is no closer to getting repaid for what it claims was price gouging by power companies going back to may than it was the day the talks began and it means the state is in for possibly more hearings before the ferc if unsuccessful there the whole issue could wind up in court for years you can take a horse to water but cannot make him drink wagner said during an afternoon public session where he made his preliminary recommendation he has seven days to put his ideas in writing at several points during the often tense talks wagner expressed frustration to the negotiators and tried to get them to agree even to the point of holding an unprecedented sunday session the numbers were too far apart wagner said while kahn insisted the state had made progress on hearing of the judge s comments state sen john burton d francisco called them barely better than a jab in the eye with a sharp stick burton agreed with kahn that the state has to do all it can to get more than that and davis backed up his team our delegation made a clear and compelling factual argument that there were overcharges made because the market was broken davis said remarkably the energy generators and suppliers refused to recognize their responsibility to the people of california and own up to their profiteering power generators seemed satisfied with the judge s views even though john stout vice president of reliant energy said his company s fundamental position has been and remains that no refunds are justified brent bailey general counsel for duke energy called the judge s recommendation a fair one republican lawmakers in sacramento were quick to say it was davis failed energy policies that brought california to this point they also distanced themselves from the state s refund request i don t believe there really exists a true justification for that number said assemblyman john campbell r irvine i ve never considered that anything more than a wild number to throw out there the two sides are so far apart in their estimates of overcharges because they are using different assumptions about how to compute the complex pricing structure and wagner was more persuaded with the majority of the generators methods to start with the state is asking for billion but about billion of those alleged overcharges happened between may and october a period ferc is not looking at ferc issued two refund orders in march finding that power companies had million in overcharges during power alerts but the state is challenging that finding saying there were overcharges beyond those limited times and the state is also asking ferc to reconsider allowing refunds for may to october how energy panel affects california six months ago few people had heard of ferc now the federal energy regulatory commission the agency charged with making sure that the nation s power markets are running smoothly and that wholesale prices are just and reasonable rolls off the tongue the five commissioners who make up ferc all of whom were members of their home state s public utilities commissions ordered the settlement talks that concluded monday they had hoped all the parties involved in california s electricity crisis could reach an agreement on proposed refunds long term power contracts and other issues that have divided the parties for months ferc s chief judge curtis wagner was asked to mediate the talks what was at stake for the state billion that gov gray davis said was the amount power companies overcharged california in the past year wagner s finding there should be refunds but more like billion for the generators more than billion that they say they are owed for unpaid power bills wagner s finding generators are owed more money than the refunds they owe california he did not specify by how much for california consumers a stable electricity market until the refund issue is settled and power prices are stabilized long term what the future holds for rate increase remains uncertain wagner s finding no settlement consumers still in limbo how did we get here in spring wholesale power prices began to soar the state began appealing to ferc to cap wholesale prices in the meantime the utilities were running out of money generators weren t paid for all the electricity they sold rolling blackouts began starting in january the state began buying the power replacing the near bankrupt utilities politicians from sacramento to washington increased the pressure on ferc to cap rates more than billion was spent to buy power for california last year compared with billion the year before the price tag could reach billion this year on june ferc imposed the kind of soft price caps experts say could moderate wholesale rates wholesale prices have come down but the caps have caused confusion among generators leading some to hold some power off the market what s next the ferc commissioners will receive wagner s report within a week in it he will suggest they hold a fast track formal hearing that would last no more than days if they agree after that hearing the commission would rule on refunds and other california market issues if either the state or the other parties to this dispute disagree they can contest ferc s decision in court such legal proceedings could last many years state reveals details of power purchases report shows last minute energy buys in first three months of july by jennifer coleman the associated press sacramento on three days in may california s daily power allowance topped million according to a report released by state power traders the california department of water resources released the report monday along with pages of documents that also detailed the last minute power purchases the state made on the spot market in the first three months of the year the report details the department s electricity spending since jan when the state took over electricity purchases for pacific gas electric co san diego gas electric co and southern california edison the utilities had amassed billions in debts and were no longer creditworthy enough to purchase power since then the state has spent nearly billion to keep the lights on the state s daily spending peaked may at million the second highest daily total was may when the state spent million but since may spot market prices have dropped due in part to moderate weather lower natural gas prices increased conservation that lowered demand and because of increased scrutiny by lawmakers and investigators into possible price manipulation gov gray davis has said long term contracts also drove the price down it does look like some of the spot market prices have gone down but it looks like it s primarily due to natural gas prices said jamie fisfis spokesman for assembly republicans the slight reduction in spot market prices underscores questions about the strategy of locking us into long term contracts if natural gas prices continue to drop fisfis said most of the long term contracts run for years with one lasting for years davis already has released details of the state s long term power contracts after losing a court battle with republican legislators and several news organizations but davis wanted to delay the release of the spot market buys and short term contracts until now to keep the state s buying strategy secret according to the state atlanta based mirant corp got billion as of may for spot market purchases canadian powerex the marketing arm of bc hydro has been paid billion the newly released short term contracts also show that on march when the state had rolling blackouts the state paid above average prices in its largest short term contracts for example mirant sold the state megawatt hours at off peak usage times on march for a megawatt hour more than above the average price of tuesday july ghost of bob citron roaming halls of capitol gray davis is following footsteps of former o c treasurer into fiscal chaos john m w moorlach mr moorlach is the orange county treasurer tax collector a recent l a times poll found that californians still remain unconvinced that our state suffers from a shortage of energy perhaps the state s subsidizing of the actual costs for electricity these past five months has caused us to believe that everything is fine it is not the state has been spending an average of million a medium sized city s annual budget per day for electricity now california is headed toward the same financial catastrophe that was imposed on its shareholder owned utilities finding one of them in chapter bankruptcy and another on the precipice at this pace it will not be long before the state will be staring a chapter bankruptcy filing in the face that s why i m gnawed by this d j vu sensation the similarities and parallels between california of and orange county of are frightening here s a refresher in the county through former treasurer robert citron was borrowing at variable rates and investing at fixed rates the experts and the politicos were comfortable with the investment scheme no wonder the electorate was convinced that there were no investing improprieties even while their former treasurer was very secretive about how he was investing and what his exit strategy would be guess what the unexpected happened short term borrowing rates doubled the cost of borrowing suddenly exceeded the revenues being generated it caused the investment pool to implode and orange county taxpayers realized a billion loss in spite of pleas to avoid or minimize this train wreck the county s leadership he ignored it the rest is history in a half pregnant deregulation scheme the state capped the retail price that the utilities can charge it also eliminated the availability to acquire electricity through the use of long term contracts guess what the unexpected happened the wholesale price for electricity spiked dramatically above the inflexible retail price cap it depleted the available funds for the utilities and then some and they are imploding in spite of pleas from the utilities imploring gov gray davis to avoid or minimize this train wreck he ignored them the rest is also history it gets worse davis doesn t allow for the immediate raising of retail rates and decides to have the state secretly purchase electricity guess what the expected happened he depleted our budget surplus our reserves nearly billion and counting he s a citron only quintupled and in the light of day the secret purchases were not attractively priced and only compound this financial nightmare gov davis has done what no libertarian or republican could ever dream of doing in such a short time he has returned the budget surplus created by taxpayers to the residents of california by subsidizing their electricity bills bravo it may not be the most equitable way of refunding taxes but has anyone ever thought up a more efficient method but that s not all he wants it back davis now wants to borrow some billion to replace the spent reserves and purchase even more electricity at rates in excess of the retail prices when does this train wreck in slow motion stop and how do we pay off these bonds davis did not want to raise rates last summer or this past winter but now he will to pay off this historically largest municipal bond offering with a significant utility rate increase the ratepayers will be reminded for years after davis is gone about his expensive brilliance and this elected official wants to purchase the power grids and bureaucratically manage the utilities i say no if we don t show some leadership in sacramento soon potential bond buyers will also say no unless they receive an attractive interest rate just ask edison international about attractive interest rates it just subscribed million in bonds paying percent tragically gov davis walked into his position with an existing budget surplus and now has no tangible legacy to show for it no reserves no improved highways no new schools no infrastructure improvements only interest payments wasn t that citron s legacy if amortized over years at percent the citizens of california will pay an additional billion in interest costs over years it s billion and therein lies the true legacy of davis squandering the entire budget surplus that he inherited on interest resulting from his indecisiveness and lack of leadership it is so tragic that the perpetrator of this colossal mess is still in denial and continues to play the blame game orange county played the blame game too but it had obvious perpetrators and succeeded in a court of law in securing a significant amount in retribution payments i m not so sure california will have a similar result

still split after week talks by joseph kahn the new york times page column c new york times company washington july a federal mediator ended two weeks of negotiations about california s demands for electricity refunds today with the state and power suppliers seemingly no closer to a settlement than when the talks began the failure of the negotiations shifts the burden of resolving the yearlong dispute to the federal energy regulatory commission to which the mediator may recommend a pricing formula that would mean refunds of about billion california which wants billion vowed today that it would seek that much and more through the courts if necessary although electricity prices in the west have eased in recent weeks the power crisis that has afflicted california and other western states seems unlikely to be resolved unless rival parties can agree on how much electricity should have cost during the last months the power market has been mired in an accounting gridlock the state claims that generating companies began grossly overcharging for electricity with prices soaring by a factor of or over year before levels beginning in late spring last year generators say they are prepared to pay some refunds but argue that california s estimates of overcharges are radically inflated the mediator in the settlement talks was curtis l wagner jr an administrative law judge for the federal agency who said today that the negotiations had failed to reach the comprehensive voluntary settlement he had sought mr wagner said he would recommend to the agency s commissioners that they convene a day evidentiary hearing that would impose an administrative solution he also said he would suggest a method for determining fair prices for electricity under federal law the energy commission has the obligation to ensure just and reasonable electricity rates though the commission declared last year that california s electricity market had broken down it only recently began imposing price controls on the market and has yet to address accusations of past overcharges systematically while the scope of any refunds remains uncertain mr wagner s remarks appeared more favorable for generators than for western states which have collectively pressed for as much as billion in refunds mr wagner said that to determine how much california should have paid for power since last september when the commission began monitoring california energy prices he would suggest that the agency retroactively apply a price control formula it adopted in june he also indicated that he supported a way of calculating the costs of power generation that is closer to the method favored by power companies than to the one put forward by california officials the judge suggested that the formula he is recommending could require generators to pay back hundreds of millions or maybe a billion dollars california officials gave a positive cast to the judge s statements calling them a step forward because he formally acknowledged that companies would have to pay some refunds they also noted that whatever the level of federally mandated refunds they would have the option of seeking more in court we are still going to get the billion said michael kahn who represented gov gray davis of california in the talks if we don t get it all from the commission we will get the remainder in the courts governor davis himself said today that if the agency did not provide refunds in the amount the state claims it is owed it would sue generators for billion to billion we are in a war with generators mostly out of state that are trying to bleed us dry mr davis said speaking at the ceremonial opening of a power plant in northern california representatives of several generating companies said that during the settlement talks they collectively offered to refund california about million they estimated that the calculation method suggested by the judge would result in refunds of no more than billion far closer to their offer than to california s demand still several executives said they now hoped to reach individual settlements with the state that would end the threat of prolonged litigation and allow them to collect several billion dollars they say they are owed by the state and its leading financially pressed utilities which ran up huge debts to suppliers in the last year we remain very interested in reaching a global settlement with the state that will put this problem behind us once and for all said brent bailey vice president and general counsel of duke energy financial energy refund talks fail in calif federal agency s judge to propose settlement peter behr the washington post final page e copyright the washington post co all rights reserved california consumers were overcharged by as much as billion by electricity suppliers since october a federal administrative judge said yesterday after state officials and power suppliers failed to reach an agreement on the disputed charges gov gray davis d and california power officials wanted billion in refunds dating back to may when the state s energy crisis began a group of generating companies headed by units of duke energy corp reliant energy inc and williams cos offered refunds of million in the past week going back to october the companies said refunds should be offset by the larger amounts they are owed for unpaid power deliveries to the state the numbers were too far apart curtis l wagner jr chief judge of the federal energy regulatory commission told reporters after two weeks of closed negotiations ended yesterday wagner acknowledged that his refund number was imprecise and said further hearings before ferc are needed to pin down the figure calpine corp of san jose and possibly one other supplier are expected to reach individual settlements with the state the judge said a lot of the parties genuinely wanted to settle and others didn t wagner told reporters there s an old southern saying said the year old tennessean you can take a horse to water but you can t make it drink he declined to say which side balked but previously he had blasted california officials for not modifying their initial demands wagner said he will send his own refund formula to ferc s five commissioners within a week his formula essentially will reflect what he thinks reasonable electricity prices would have been in the state at various times since october considering fuel costs and other factors charges over those levels would be subject to refund if ferc agrees the judge s recommendation is likely to carry considerable weight with ferc s commissioners according to energy analysts earlier this year ferc tentatively ordered million in refunds for the first three months of this year an amount that davis called far too low facing increasing political pressure from congress ferc with two new members appointed by president bush has taken a harder line on california s power prices last month the commissioners imposed price restraints on wholesale power transactions in california and other western states wagner patterned his formula after ferc s ruling last month the nation s wealthiest state has been battered by an extraordinary surge in electricity and gas prices that have pushed its electricity costs up from billion in to an estimated billion last year power prices did not retreat from record levels until last month davis s top aides quickly claimed vindication yesterday we think the numbers even using the judge s formula are going to be in the multiple billions said michael kahn chairman of the california independent system operator the state s power grid manager kahn noted that the state refused to drop a growing list of legal claims against the principal energy suppliers most of them headquartered outside the state the companies had insisted on being released from the state s legal claims as part of any settlement according to sources close to the negotiations we will have a viable claim in state court and other jurisdictions for the remainder kahn said california will get its billion but the state s own expert witness economist eric hildebrandt chief market monitor for the california grid testified before wagner that the out of state generators and other nonpublic power suppliers would owe about billion using ferc s pricing formula of last month less than half the billion goal duke energy is very pleased by wagner s action said brent bailey vice president and general counsel of the charlotte based company the generators however repeated their claims that davis is trying to make them scapegoats for the state s failed electricity deregulation plan the major generators in a statement yesterday said they had delivered only million megawatt hours out of the million the state power grid used from october to last may a megawatt supplies enough power for about homes california utilities and municipal power companies also reaped large profits the generators said the refunds sought by california would send a profoundly counterproductive message to suppliers when prices are low and surpluses exist you face a steep downside when scarcity develops and prices rise we will take away all upside profit no one will invest in california power facilities in that climate the generators statement said the power supply shortage thus will continue without relief contact economy california and energy companies miss deadline by richard b schmitt the wall street journal page a copyright c dow jones company inc washington state officials and power company executives failed to meet a federal deadline for settling billion of disputed california electricity charges as a federal mediator overseeing the talks suggested the state s demand was excessive cautioning that he hadn t done formal calculations curtis l wagner jr the chief administrative law judge of the federal energy regulatory commission put the level of potential refunds at hundreds of millions of dollars maybe a billion dollars he also said any sums due the state could well be offset by monies its insolvent utilities owe in unpaid power bills mr wagner said he would recommend to the commission that any refunds be calculated only from october the state had been seeking rebates calculated from may in line with an earlier ferc jurisdictional ruling that decision alone would shave billion from the billion claim mr wagner who is expected to issue formal findings in the next few days said he would recommend that the ferc hold an evidentiary hearing to assess the correct method for figuring refunds the collapse of the talks doesn t preclude individual deals later between energy companies and the state which has accused them of overcharging for power during the past two years yesterday some industry lawyers indicated a willingness to keep bargaining and mr wagner said two partial settlements were in the works yet absent any such solution the overcharge issue a flash point in the california power crisis is apt to be resolved in protracted legal and regulatory proceedings which could drag on for months or even years the negotiations began june with a deadline set for midnight last night but late yesterday participants indicated they were billions of dollars apart with basic differences over everything from the disputed charges to doubts about whether the ferc which ordered the talks could enforce a deal because of the industry s questions about the reach of the agency s authority we haven t reached a settlement we really haven t come close said john stout a senior vice president of reliant energy inc s wholesale power group reliant had offered to pay california about million to extricate itself from the fight that is more than a third of the houston company s operating profit during the relevant period he said although far shy of the more than million california sought from reliant mr wagner said the industry offered a total of million to settle the matter the refund issue is fast becoming a test of the agency s authority and credibility the ferc a onetime regulatory backwater has come under intense scrutiny of late for its largely hands off monitoring of deregulated california markets the commission has ordered some companies to pay refunds but they have been relatively small such as a million rebate covering wholesale electricity bills in california in january and february california gov gray davis has said he hopes two new ferc members will take a much more aggressive tack the agency is expected to act quickly on the judge s call for a hearing and other findings yesterday michael kahn a san francisco lawyer representing gov davis at the settlement declared he was gratified by mr wagner s findings saying they validated the state s claims to some refunds a concept the industry had rejected at the talks outset we ve had a ringing endorsement of the idea of refunds and we ll get back lots of money he said adding that what the state doesn t recoup via the ferc it will pursue in court but power generators who derided the state s request for a huge refund as ludicrous and unsound felt vindicated by yesterday s proceedings the state came away with far less than its expectations said robert loeffler an attorney for a unit of aes corp of arlington va the common expectation now is that any refunds will be way below this billion,Phishing,Data Breach,0.6367081988716375,False

questioned energy state official urges conflict of interest probe into purchases of shares in power firms jeffrey l rabin eric bailey times staff writers los angeles times home edition b copyright the times mirror company secretary of state bill jones on monday urged california s attorney general to investigate possible conflict of interest violations by consultants hired to help the davis administration navigate the energy crisis jones a republican candidate for governor said at a los angeles news conference that atty gen bill lockyer and the state fair political practices commission should determine whether seven of the consultants have conflicts of interest because they own stock in one or more energy companies he also asked the state s chief law enforcement officer to immediately determine whether the governor s office violated state law by exempting of the consultants from financial disclosure requirements i am gravely concerned that a cloud of illegality and collusion exists at the highest level of our state government due to the actions and the conscious policy of secrecy of gov davis jones said that brought a sharp retort from the governor s spokesman steve maviglio who attacked jones for engaging in campaign politics the secretary of state has a five person team bankrolled by the taxpayers attempting to dig up dirt for political reasons maviglio charged this is politics pure and simple being played by a candidate desperate to get his name in the paper maviglio said if there are any violations of the law he added they re going to be addressed the secretary of state s entry into the energy controversy poses yet another headache for davis as he prepares to run for a second term next year already the gop and some power producers have begun airing commercials critical of davis handling of the power crunch forcing the governor to dip into his own campaign funds to fight back jones as the state s chief elections officer contends that his concerns are not just political he noted that he appoints one of the five members of the fair political practices commission which enforces campaign finance and conflict of interest laws among other things jones questioned why vikram budhraja head of the electric power group a pasadena energy consulting firm bought stock in edison international and dynegy corp in the days before he went to work for the state budhraja was hired under a million contract between his firm and the state department of water resources that was signed on jan like two dozens of the consultants hired by the state he did not complete a financial disclosure statement until last week more than six months after he went to work for the department which now buys power for the state s three largest utilities the financial disclosure statement filed by budhraja last thursday shows that he bought between and worth of dynegy stock on jan six days later he bought between and of edison stock that was the same day that davis declared a state of emergency because of the energy crisis and ordered the department of water resources to begin buying power on behalf of the state s financially troubled major utilities on jan budhraja again bought between and of edison stock on his disclosure statement he indicated that he began work for the state jan and sold the stock on jan the first opportunity he had to divest his holdings jones told reporters that budhraja s investments in edison grew by to while his dynegy investment increased in that brief period budhraja was also on retainer as a consultant to edison international earning more than in the year before becoming a contractor for the state maviglio said budhraja wrote a letter to dwr deputy director ray hart saying he had no dealings with edison international he also was not involved in any long term contracting with edison any profits budhraja made from the stock are irrelevant because the stock was sold by the time he was on the job maviglio said another consultant bernard barretto who describes himself as an energy trader scheduler for the state disclosed last week that he purchased stock in power producer enron corp but no date or amount of the purchase was listed financial disclosure forms filed last week by five other consultants show they all own stock in calpine corp a major california based power wholesaler energy trader elaine l griffin bought between and worth of calpine stock on feb her contract with the state began feb griffin s newly completed economic disclosure statement does not show her selling the stock herman leung who went to work as an electricity scheduler in march bought between and worth of calpine stock on jan schedulers william f mead peggy cheng and constantine louie also disclosed that they own stock in calpine mead in fact said his holdings ranged between and million but their forms contain an important omission the consultants do not say when they purchased the shares oscar hidalgo a water resources spokesman said the agency s attorney is reviewing all the past purchases to ensure that no laws were violated by contractors buying power or negotiating long term contracts with companies in which they held stock we re reviewing all that to see if there were any problems with any past negotiations hidalgo said we re looking at all the records in past buys or trades so we understand who exactly did what he said it s a very big task that will take weeks to complete in the meantime those contractors who have disclosed stock ownership have been recused from working with generators in which they have a financial interest the governor s spokesman said several of the contractors who own stock in calpine are not traders and thus do not have direct dealings with the company if you own calpine stock and aren t doing any business with calpine then you re fine maviglio said calpine is one of a number of firms that negotiated long term contracts with the state and that have come under fire from critics who say they will saddle consumers with artificially high electricity costs for years to come for weeks jones has been sharply critical of the administration s failure to require its consultants to file conflict of interest forms which must be completed within days of a person starting work the governor s spokesman said the administration was told by the state s political watchdog agency that only consultants serving in a staff capacity or participating in decisions must file the forms as a result he said only two dozen of the consultants were required to complete the paperwork most of them hastily and clumsily prepared last week according to the secretary of state two of those who have not filed are wall street executives joseph fichera and michael hoffman key advisors to davis on his plans to rescue california s debt ridden utilities in that role according to their contract they could make millions maviglio said the two men who have done extensive work for private energy companies are squeaky clean but he would not elaborate copyright dow jones company inc all rights reserved uk lme disciplines enron metals accepts settlememt

americas in downtown miami lost million for its fiscal year ended march warned investors about its need to raise additional capital and noted that its auditors have concerns about the company s ability to its operations in a report issued july and included in terremark s filings with the securities and exchange commission the company s independent auditors pricewaterhousecoopers in fort lauderdale said that terremark has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net liquidity deficit that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern however manny medina terremark s chairman and ceo remains confident that the investors that have backed him will continue to do so he said he has always raised the financing as he needs it rather than stockpiling capital in the bank that s the way he said he has been doing business for years medina said the going concern letter from the auditors is just a black and white issue you have to have your business plan funded for the next months or you get a going concern letter from the auditors a going concern letter does indicate that a company needs additional financing said accounting sources yet issuing such a letter is not a practice that auditors take lightly they added in documents filed monday with the sec terremark noted there can be no assurance that any financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all medina said terremark s ability to finish this project has been questioned from day one but the building is finished the customers are signed up and the traffic is running medina was referring to the technology center of the americas where the nap is housed terremark oversaw the construction of that facility in downtown miami terremark put in place a million debt and

versions of the nap in miami in latin america and the far east benjamin finzi executive vice president of epik communications and head of the consortium of more than telecom firms which supported the building of the nap in miami said he hadn t seen terremark s actual financial statements however finzi said that in the past medina has assured consortium members that his investors would continue to back the financing of the nap and its continued operations other sources close to terremark said that medina has always preferred to raise the capital he needs in the capital markets because it has greater credibility but they believe medina could tap his investors some in the far east and others in the middle east to continue funding this project rather than let it fail yet the financing market for telecom companies remains difficult many firms including possible tenants for the nap have pulled back their expansion and cut back operations because they don t have the capital and they don t sufficient revenues at this point to their day to day business one investment banker who follows the company noted that the auditor s letter would make it more difficult for terremark to raise the capital it needs to fund its expansion into latin america and the far east terremark said it hopes to refinance at more favorable terms for the tecota financing package the financing includes million in debt and million in equity during the latter part of its fiscal year the company placed million in convertible debt via a private placement the net loss from operations for the fiscal year was million compared to million in the fiscal year revenue for the year rose to million from million terremark s fiscal year loss of million includes a one time charge of million for discontinued

company inc los angeles dow jones a california senate committee is likely to drop a contempt charge against enron corp ene tuesday because the company is close to agreeing to provide information for an investigation into wholesale electricity prices sen joe dunn d santa ana said late monday there has been a dramatic change and i am optimistic that by noon tuesday there will be a resolution with enron said dunn who chairs the senate select committee to investigate market manipulation the committee voted last week to forward a contempt charge to the full senate because enron refused to provide certain financial documents and sign the committee s version of a confidentiality agreement if the full senate voted to hold enron in contempt it could issue punishments including hefty fines and incarceration of executives g the committee also voted last week to drop its contempt charge at any time before a full senate vote if enron agreed to meet the committee s requests enron has chosen to intimate to us that they will comply with our demands they have asked us for the ability to preserve certain objections there s a possibility we may be sued by other market participants and if so enron wants to preserve its opportunities to pursue objections at that time dunn said enron filed a lawsuit last week to stop the committee s subpoena of financial records and a company attorney said during hearings that enron was likely to contest the contempt charge as well in talks monday however enron mentioned the possibility of dropping the lawsuit dunn said which is not a requirement to the committee s dropping the contempt charge no one at enron could be reached immediately for comment the documents sought by the price manipulation committee include information on bidding and pricing behavior in the state s electricity markets the committee originally was poised to cite seven other electricity generators for contempt but all eventually agreed to provide the requested information

the alliance for retail energy markets arem today announced its strong opposition to abx the state assembly democrats most recent alternative to the southern california edison mou as drafted this new legislation seeks to immediately close the door on direct access and prevent the restoration of retail choice until at least this will effectively remove the ability of customers to take control of their own energy supply needs thereby rendering them hostage to the utilities this bill is about putting edison back on its feet and putting edison s competitors out of business said rick counihan of green mountain energy company customers right to choose the best energy option to meet their needs and the needs of the environment is being trampled in the name of restoring a monopoly furthermore abx raises questions about the status of existing contracts and current customers who may be forced under the provisions of this bill to return to extremely high priced power under the utilities in many ways this bill is worse than ab x because it threatens to nullify extension contracts for current direct access customers said aaron thomas with aes newenergy this would force customers to return to utility service which would require the state to buy even more power than it has already arem stressed that it is long overdue for policy makers to promote an equitable and workable retail energy

pressure on dutch energy market watchdog dte to force electricity generators to disclose commercially sensitive plant status information is mounting monday electricity traders wrote an open letter through voeg a free trade association for electricity and gas that generators in the netherlands be forced to publish information on power plant outages i have been saying it for ages generators should let the market know what they re doing at their plants said a trader with a large utility while another said voeg s proposal if agreed would lead to a more stable honest market voeg is reacting to recent hikes in prices for dutch spot electricity those prices have soared in recent weeks reaching levels of up to eur a megawatt hour on some days from around eur mwh on a normal day traders have been speculating that unreported generator outages are at least part of the reason for the price hikes unscheduled outages are especially problematic in the dutch market because of the small volumes traded reserve plant is difficult to bring on line quickly and readily available imported power is limited by congestion on the country s transmission lines when generators or suppliers are forced to cover short positions at short notice the result is therefore usually extreme also traders have said they suspect generators of deliberately pushing up prices by cutting output generators have always denied such allegations and no conclusive evidence has ever been presented against them clyde murley spokesman for reliant energy inc rei which owns the dutch generator una said information on the status of una s plant is just too commercially sensitive to make public he said the generator doesn t approve of voeg s ideas but declined to be drawn on their possible consequences a spokeswoman for belgian based electrabel sa b ele also active as a generator in the netherlands also said it categorically doesn t want to disclose such information dte spokesman hans jacobs declined to comment on voeg s letter jacobs said dte is mapping market opinions on the way the dutch electricity market functions in response to the electricity price hikes voeg is responding to we expect that process to be concluded at the end of this month jacobs said we will then consider possible measures he added though that the dte hasn t ruled out forcing generators to publish outage details whether or not such outages are caused by maintenance monday s letter isn t the first on this subject to fall on dte s doormat last week a group of foreign power traders on the dutch market sent a similar one to the watchdog signatories to that letter included such parties as enron corp ene aquila inc ila and txu corp txu and dutch companies eneco and remu generators active in the netherlands aren t required to publish any information over outages in contrast to the nord pool market that covers denmark norway sweden and finland since deregulation european countries such as the u k germany and spain have

to millions of tv viewers propels books to bestsellerdom and last year teamed up with hearst magazines cathie black no on the list to publish o the oprah magazine by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever at no is andrea jung chairman and ceo of avon who has breathed life into ailing avon mirant ceo marce fuller the only newcomer in the top five holds the no position inside a stodgy utility southern fuller built a high growth trading and marketing unit which was spun off in april in these new more tempered times patience may be about to reap its reward in fortune s annual survey of the most powerful women in business there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly says fortune senior writer pattie sellers in patient but not passive the story that accompanies the list by patience we mean staying with a company steadily building influence there and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge not promises and self promotion fiorina who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune s inaugural list in heads the biggest company billion in revenues last year run by a woman and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever wall street practically heckled her latest move a bold bet to buy compaq but fiorina remains defiant in difficult times people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny she says as always the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time last year power resided in the technology and internet sectors but that influence was fleeting gone from the list this year deborah hurricane debby hopkins who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ellen hancock who failed at the startup exodus and morgan stanley s mary meeker who influenced so many to buy

economy and its points of power change the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same says sellers we consider the size and importance of a woman s business in the global economy her clout inside her company and the arc of her career where she has been and where she is likely to go when appropriate we also weigh the woman s influence on mass culture and society that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no on this year s list the shifts on our list this year are dramatic with newcomers but one trend is especially intriguing women are taking on bigger businesses than ever a few years ago responsibility for a billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list no more this year s fortune includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of billion or more which is a first in a related story it took a lady to save avon katrina brooker looks at andrea jung chairman and ceo of avon says brooker jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them and that s what has made her one of the most successful ceos male or female in recent years over the past months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business how it advertises manufactures packages and even sells its products and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady but by reviving her the result growth in revenues operating profits and

economy money magazine enron ceo skilling reinvents company unnerving investors new york enron ceo skilling reinvents company unnerving investors published in may issue of bloomberg markets houston may bloomberg a year ago enron corp ceo jeffrey skilling put up a banner in the lobby of his company s houston office tower that welcomed visitors to the world s leading energy company skilling has now decided that the company s tag should be more ambitious the world s leading company the banner says today it s no shock that even the ceo isn t sure how to describe enron for it s a company swept by constant change in the s skilling transformed a regulated gas pipeline company into the largest competitor in the business of trading energy mainly natural gas and electric power now skilling is pushing the company into internet trading of all sorts of things paper products plastics metals fiber optic bandwidth commercial credit pollution emission controls and even weather derivatives all of this morphing unnerves investors and some of the company s ventures may not be growing as fast as enron says according to analysts and industry insiders they say the company is overstating the value of the new businesses it s entering some investors are increasingly concerned about a lack of clarity regarding where the company is going and what exactly it does now owning enron is a bit of a leap of faith said john hancock advisers inc mutual fund manager greg phelps who invests billion in utility stocks and doesn t own any enron i want to buy a stock where i have absolute certainty about the business and direction it s headed exuding nervous energy skilling a man who exudes nervous energy and speaks in rapid fire bursts says his track record should ease investors concerns in the first quarter of enron s profit from operations rose percent to million as revenue almost quadrupled to billion enron shares have soared more than fold since the start of the decade four times the gain of the standard poor s index enron s shares have dropped percent this year closing at on april enron isn t merely a trading company skilling says it s a logistics concern that ties together supply and demand for any given commodity and then figures out the most cost efficient way to deliver that commodity to its destination skilling who joined enron in after leading mckinsey co s energy and chemical consulting practices is unapologetic about moving the company in so many different directions in five years we ll be a different company he said we re not finished reinventing ourselves billion in assets enron owns billion in assets including miles of pipeline that span states and transport percent of all of the natural gas consumed in the u s the company owns an mile fiber optic network in the u s and controls power plants and other energy projects in countries on four continents pinpointing what enron does isn t easy some businesses are simple to grasp in enron won billion in energy management contracts from such giant corporations as owens illinois inc and international business machines corp the bulk of enron s money percent of revenue and more than four fifths of profit in came from wholesale energy operations and services what it calls the financialization of energy cloaked in secrecy this is largely the gas and electricity trading business it pioneered enron cloaks the details of that business in secrecy citing competitive reasons which makes its bread and butter activities as difficult to understand as the abstract joan miro lithograph that looms behind skilling s desk enron keeps a lot of facts close to the vest said andre meade an analyst at commerzbank capital markets that makes constructing earnings models a real challenge even many of enron s employees are shielded from the intricacies of enron s business signs in stairwells and on office walls forbid employees from freely moving around the building into trading rooms and other off limits areas for now wall street is betting that behind closed doors skilling and company will figure out how to extend enron s trading prowess into fast growing industries of the analysts who track enron of them rate the stock a buy enron traded at times earnings on april that s exactly double the price earnings ratio of for rival duke energy corp the biggest u s utility owner and energy trader and percent higher than the s p s april multiple ge of the new economy enron is uniquely positioned to be the ge of the new economy said merrill lynch s donato eassey this isn t a management team to bet against with analyst expectations so positive some longtime enron holders are selling stock especially with its high valuation the stock s risky and i don t see much upside said timothy ghriskey senior portfolio manager at dreyfus corp which controls funds that sold about million enron shares at the end of if they fail to deliver for one reason or another things could get ugly enron says its sales will swell to at least billion analysts and investors say there are several trouble spots that could slow its growth trading broadband bandwidth at a late january meeting in houston skilling told analysts and investors and dozens of others hooked in via the web that enron s biggest immediate opportunity is its plan to trade broadband bandwidth space on the fiber optic networks that zip voices data and images around the planet skilling says that based on discounted cash flow enron s broadband business is worth billion or a share that s a hefty valuation considering the business lost million on million in revenue in enron has already hit a major roadblock in part of its broadband plan delivering videos over its own high speed fiber optic network in march enron and blockbuster inc broke off a planned year venture to deliver movies and other content directly into customers homes enron says blockbuster didn t provide the quantity and quality of movies needed to deliver the service enron and blockbuster disagree blockbuster has a different take blockbuster wanted out of the deal basically because we had a lack of confidence in enron said karen raskopf blockbuster s vice president of corporate communications specifically blockbuster maintains that enron couldn t handle technical issues such as protecting the copyright of the films that were to be distributed maybe enron could have worked those details out raskopf said but we decided there were plenty of other carriers out there that were more sophisticated technically several analysts and industry executives say that enron s broadband business isn t worth anywhere near the valuation that skilling talks about i don t want to be disrespectful because enron s made remarkable progress from its days as a regulated pipeline said leo hindery jr former ceo of global crossing ltd which like enron has a nationwide fiber optic network but they re way out of their league in the telecommunications business the valuation numbers they throw around are laughable they ll be a bit player at best california energy crisis the california energy crisis is likely to derail ongoing efforts to deregulate electricity markets in about states and could slow the opening of markets in several asian and european countries as well analysts and consultants say eliminating future profit streams not so says skilling deregulation is here to stay despite the problems in california he said adding deregulation doesn t cause problems stupid deregulation does besides he said enron merely trades and doesn t produce power in california the company s biggest business is in the wholesale market serving utilities and big industrial suppliers not retail customers japan and europe are opening up plus wholesale markets in japan and europe are rapidly opening up california won t nick us he said critics charge that enron which doesn t reveal its california financial results has been reaping huge profits during the crisis california has been a feeding frenzy with every trading company in the world feasting on it and enron is the biggest and shrewdest of them all said michael shames executive director of the utility consumers action network doubters wonder whether enron can succeed in new businesses like fiber i don t think this industry is going to evolve as swiftly as enron believes it will said rod woodward a telecom services industry analyst at consultancy frost sullivan inc skilling brushes off such skepticism people who throw stones at us don t keep me up at night he said i worry about whether the air conditioner will blow and knock out our computer servers proving naysayers wrong skilling contends he s proved the naysayers wrong once before in at the colorado ski resort of beaver creek in his first presentation to energy analysts and investors skilling outlined his plan to transform enron from an asset based pipeline company into a trading company i basically laid out our trading model for them said skilling the crowd yawned they didn t get it i was brilliant so we went out and proved we were right skilling s intensity permeates enron s headquarters in the lobby about employees wait in line for a starbucks coffee jolt at p m in the company s elevators tvs blare with messages to maximize revenue there aren t many private offices in enron s headquarters building most floors are open to encourage communication between workers of the few walls that are around many are write and wash to encourage extemporaneous diagramming skilling s office is filled with toys a mini basketball hoop koosh ball rackets for his two sons he s divorced and also has a daughter mile bicycle ride he s working himself into shape so this spring he can lead about employees on a mile bicycle ride from austin to houston for charity he says he hates his th floor office with its foot ceilings mahogany paneling and sweeping views of the nation s fourth largest city it s too quiet and too removed from any action he said so he s moving to the seventh floor trading room of a story tower being built across the street from enron s current headquarters even on vacations skilling doesn t kick back every year the pittsburgh native and harvard business school graduate takes important customers on a trip this isn t the sedate corporate golf outing to augusta national or pebble beach skilling leads such jaunts as a seven day trek through the australian outback and a thousand mile dirt bike expedition in mexico if i can t bust up a couple bikes i don t really want to go he said gung ho atmosphere that sort of gung ho atmosphere is a far cry from enron s early days in when it was formed by the billion merger of internorth and houston national gas and became the largest natural gas pipeline company in the u s the industry was in the midst of great upheaval as the federal energy regulatory commission began deregulating the gas pipeline business until then the business could have been the poster boy for overregulation by federal law companies that owned pipelines could sell gas only to a handful of gas and electric utilities along their routes if there were a big freeze in chicago or a heat wave in atlanta for instance pipelines couldn t reroute their supply to meet demand in chairman kenneth lay retained skilling who was then a consultant at mckinsey to help spot opportunities as the business deregulated government loosens rules over the next few years as the government slowly loosened rules skilling put together a plan to buy natural gas reserves and package them for sale at various prices to any number of customer specifications fixed prices floating prices with minimum and maximum caps guaranteed increases in supply if temperatures soared or plummeted both enron officials and outside analysts say that companies would save as much as percent of their cost of buying gas and enron would profit from the trades and from packaging other lucrative services such as futures and swaps contracts that companies use to hedge their energy costs there was a lot of initial resistance said skilling who joined enron permanently in august enron engineers had no concept about what we were trying to do they wanted to see the gas it was like trading pork bellies and asking to see the pigs big trading floors with lay s backing skilling pressed ahead he ripped out walls and built big trading floors to foster interaction at first the business grew slowly through phone based trading desks in the early days we d sit on our hands a lot said keith hannon who was in enron s power business and is now president and chief operating officer of enron s broadband unit it took a while to find buyers and sellers and convince them what we could do in the late s enron extended its gas trading business to electricity the u s government encouraged competition in via the energy policy act about half of the states began enacting laws or rules to let electricity generators compete for retail customers on price which opened the door for enron to replicate its buy and sell gas trading model for electricity in april as internet mania began sweeping through even old line corporations john sherriff head of enron s european operations and greg whalley who was head trader at the time decided to take another look at using the internet to boost trading volumes torpedoes previous efforts skilling had torpedoed previous online efforts fearing the complexity of trading energy online and concerned that opening up the system would expose enron to too much risk so well known was his aversion to risk that the team of employees that created enrononline didn t even tell skilling about it until two weeks before it was ready to launch it isn t a typical business to business exchange that brings buyers and sellers together to negotiate trades at enrononline which cost million to put together enron does all of the buying and selling a trader with gas to market sells it to enron which then finds a buyer for the fuel enron either finds a way to deliver the gas or ships it through its own pipes that system enables enron to skim a profit at every stage of the transaction buying selling and transporting the commodity in addition to packing on lucrative services such as swaps options and forwards competitors say that energy buyers won t be satisfied with a site that allows them to buy from only one supplier enrononline a market is buyers sellers and speculators said harvey padewer president of duke energy group which oversees duke energy s nonutility business enrononline is come buy from me and that isn t a market skilling counters that enron s results speak for themselves in its first full year of operation enrononline completed transactions with a total value of billion and its european business posted a threefold increase in power trading and a fourfold gain in gas trading enron s trading and risk management business did especially well last year with revenue up percent and profit up percent because of wide price swings in california and other markets this past winter those swings prompt energy buyers and sellers to try to lock in prices which enron does with futures forwards and other financial instruments volatility is what a trader like enron thrives on said merrill lynch s eassey volatility brings competitors the volatility also brought in scores of competitors last july six of enron s biggest rivals including duke and el paso energy corp bought stakes in the intercontinental exchange as part of a plan to take business from enrononline entergy corp a new orleans power company and koch industries inc a closely held refiner and gas pipeline owner formed an energy trading venture in april other companies including bloomberg l p parent company of bloomberg news and baycorp holdings ltd owner of a new hampshire utility have developed electronic marketplaces for energy room for everyone skilling says there s room for everyone the total wholesale gas and power market in north america europe and japan will grow to trillion over the next several years from billion today according to enron estimates only about percent of that market has deregulated said skilling so we still have more than half of the market to go i think a lot of that will be transacted online while the competition is catching up in the business that enron pioneered the company is forging ahead into new opportunities such as weather people laugh when they hear about us and i hate that said gene taylor marketing director of enron s weather risk management business we ve processed transactions since and have been profitable in each of the last three years weather brokers at other companies say that enron s claims sound reasonable this past autumn for example an executive at bombardier inc a montreal aerospace company that also makes snowmobiles did an internet search for weather trading and found enron bombardier was offering customers who bought new snowmobiles by october a refund if total snowfall in their area was less than half of the average of the prior three years bombardier example enron collected money from bombardier for each snowmobile sold and paid premiums in march so bombardier could refund customers in low snowfall areas enron has doubled to the size of its weather trading staff and has tripled to the number of meteorologists plucking talent from places like the weather channel to grow the business taylor says his analysis of earnings reports reveals that the bottom lines of percent of all publicly traded companies are somehow affected by weather i see no reason why anyone should wear weather risk when they hedge away things like currency fluctuations taylor said by bringing weather trading online we have a big opportunity to bring in hundreds of companies and process thousands of weather trades other major players in this business include southern co aquila inc and koch energy trading fiber optic broadband opportunity skilling says weather is a sideshow compared with enron s biggest business opportunity fiber optic broadband the hair thin glass tubing that transmits data at the speed of light until now telecommunications carriers at t and level communications inc among them had sold bandwidth in fixed rate monthly contracts locking buyers into paying for capacity they didn t always need enron can offer customers only as much bandwidth as they need and on short notice in october for example enron signed a three year pact to manage the fiber optic needs of i technologies inc a dallas based internet software company under the deal terms of which weren t disclosed enron will provide i with the capacity to link its headquarters with offices in parsippany new jersey tokyo brussels and mumbai and bangalore india on an as needed basis enron will use its own network as well as other unspecified network providers where profits will come from skilling expects to profit in the broadband business in other ways as well he hopes enron s trading system will sell more service through its own network which covers miles a small portion of the miles of fiber in the u s he also expects to make money on the spread between buy and sell prices for the bandwidth as well as on related activities like risk management if successful enron says the business could prove to be a gold mine the global broadband market will expand to as much as billion in from billion in skilling says and he estimates it could generate billion in annual operating profits in five years aggressive estimates those estimates are too aggressive several analysts consultants and industry executives say especially since at least different fiber optic networks span north america alone and excess capacity has driven prices down about percent in a year i give them credit for trying to change the market but they re spreading a lot of misinformation said chris lemmer executive director of broadband trading and risk management at rival williams communications group inc in tulsa oklahoma lemmer says skilling is looking at the entire broadband universe wholesale retail and residential services when he projects industry growth it s unlikely lemmer charges that enron can get a healthy slice of each of these disparate businesses competitors like lemmer say that enron isn t being realistic and that its lack of expertise in the business is showing this isn t the gas business where you can stick pipe in the ground and leave it there for years said lemmer in this business infrastructure continually changes and enron seems to be ignoring that because it interferes with the propaganda they re trying to spread billion value for business so far the results don t seem to justify skilling s billion value for the business though enron says the number of broadband trading transactions in the first quarter of has risen to from just in the same period a year ago the business isn t yet profitable in the fourth quarter the broadband business reported a million loss on revenue of million they really have to post the numbers and show that the broadband business is going somewhere said commerzbank analyst meade company history a glimpse at company history reveals that enron doesn t always deliver what it promises a case in point is the company s october purchase of wessex water plc of the u k for billion in cash and assumed debt enron officials spoke of the water business in much the same way they now talk about broadband it s a fragmented international market worth billion a year and enron could extend its expertise to this business and win a huge share of that market lay tapped enron vice chairman rebecca mark one of the most prominent women in u s business as chairman and ceo of azurix corp an enron subsidiary that was supposed to win projects to repair build or buy government owned water systems mark cut a distinctive figure in the male dominated industry wearing spike heels and miniskirts as she traveled the globe negotiating complex energy projects azurix s performance never matched expectations the company was spun off in an initial public offering at a share in june the stock rose to a high of in august and then plunged all the way down to by october executive quits that prevented azurix from using its stock for acquisitions as the company had originally planned mark quit in august and resigned from enron s board an azurix official says mark plans to be a private investor in other water businesses in december enron bought back azurix for million or a share skilling says he s learned lessons from enron s struggles helping him create what he describes as the prototype st century corporation it s part of the learning curve he said i think our legacy will be that we proved you can build a business on intellectual capital not physical assets a self described business history buff skilling argues that the era of corporate success based on gathering assets is over he says modern companies that try to emulate j p morgan s assembling of u s steel or harold geneen s buying spree to form itt are making a mistake exxon mobil merger he cites in particular the creation of exxon mobil corp and daimler benz ag s cross border acquisition of chrysler corp mergers like exxon mobil were good ideas to cut costs but they ll run out of opportunities and we won t he said that s because he argues enron isn t tied to its assets in the same way as a big integrated company if you re stuck with a whole bunch of concrete that you can t move you re in trouble he said only about percent of enron s billion in assets is tied up in plants and equipment and skilling says he s willing to sell anything anytime skilling says he d rather spend money retaining good people who are easily shifted around to new businesses we re brain power intensive skilling said when enron created its broadband business for example it moved people mainly from enron s energy trading units into the new division in the space of a week skilling not shy skilling doesn t shy away from voicing his opinions publicly in december he stunned the crowd at arthur andersen llp s annual energy symposium in houston by predicting the demise of exxon mobil an enterprise with billion in profit in and bp amoco plc the third largest publicly traded oil company he said that integrated oil companies ones that drill for oil and natural gas transport and refine it and sell the resulting fuels to consumers can t possibly be the low cost provider and producer in all of their businesses the odds of that are zero he said we have a marketplace now that can provide virtual integration getting all those components quicker and cheaper these big companies will topple over from their own weight soon after that speech skilling was promoted to ceo as lay stepped aside lay who remains chairman said the best time for succession to occur was when the company is doing well fine judgments there s always the danger that skilling will misjudge which industries are ripe for enron s internet trading platform and that some of enron s biggest initiatives like its much ballyhooed plans to shake up the broadband business won t meet their lofty expectations there are heightened competition and the possibility for unfavorable changes in the regulatory environment to worry about as well skilling says his new job and the challenges that come with it won t change too much the way he operates i ll probably have to be a little less blunt he said for all of enron s grand plans that might be this former pipeline company s biggest pipe dream adam levy in atlanta or adamlevy bloomberg net kl

crunch by noah rothbaum smartmoney c smartmoney all rights reserved we ve all seen what energy deregulation has done to california could it happen in your state this summer we put the question to kenneth lay chairman of enron north america s largest marketer of electricity and natural gas an early supporter of deregulation lay has testified before congress on numerous occasions advocating deregulation q what went wrong in california a they didn t deregulate they tried to but they never got there california was halfway in between the wholesale market was deregulated but prices for customers were fixed and fixed in a way that competitors could not compete for customers without losing money q do you still think deregulation is a good idea a we think complete deregulation with consumer choice and competition will result in the lowest prices and the best alternatives for consumers including a lot of innovations q are there other deregulated states that may run into problems a the new england states aren t nearly as competitive there is a good chance they will have problems this summer it could be a power crisis or their consumers will not end up with the benefits that customers in places like pennsylvania get new york will probably be very tight but it moved very quickly after last summer to buy turbines i am told they will be generating electricity by this summer so new york well may avoid a serious problem q will we see blackouts in other states besides california this summer a the most vulnerable area this summer is california and because of that other

generation also called distributed generation known to the cognoscenti simply as dg distributed generation technologies include microturbines small scale generators fuel cells which generate electricity with an electrochemical reaction and flywheels which store kinetic energy within a rapidly spinning wheel and while it appears to be a drastic move even for power hungry companies dg offers tantalizing possibilities to investors who can stomach the risk of an emerging technology one thing s for sure the energy shortage isn t going away the u s power grid is facing an alarming supply and demand imbalance according to scott sitzer an economist at the energy information administration u s consumption of electricity increased at a percent annual rate between and while capacity rose just percent a year for the next years the agency forecasts demand growth of percent per year which will require at least megawatts of additional capacity to satisfy but only megawatts worth of power plants have been approved for construction over the next five years according to john hammerschmidt portfolio manager and energy analyst at the top performing mutual fund company turner investment partners and supply isn t the only problem quality matters too even a one second interruption in power can wreak havoc on data centers which require reliability the u s baseload power grid can only offer three nines reliability or percent which means in one year you ll be down an average of eight hours says hammerschmidt the digital economy can t take blips it needs to get up to six nines so it s easy to see why dg could be a hot growth area over the next to years dg could become to percent of u s generating capacity says bernie ziemianek director of distributed resources at the electric power research institute a palo alto calif based r d firm hammerschmidt agrees he launched the turner energy power technology fund on mar there are ipos on the shelf in this area he says this is going to be a very very hot investable area providing great returns over the next several years these volatile stocks are not for the faint hearted having been caught up in the tech frenzy of last year many have crashed to sobering levels with the nasdaq most are losing money but hammerschmidt doesn t see a dot com style bubble for dg i don t think they will get hyped to ridiculous valuation levels he says because they re competing against the cost of a kilowatt hour one of his favorites is active power acpw which is down percent from its week high active is a leader in flywheel technology which hammerschmidt sees as better than batteries for backup before a generator kicks in which can take seven or eight seconds unlike batteries which need to be replaced flywheels need no maintenance and basically last forever he says he also likes the fact that active has a marketing agreement with caterpillar the no manufacturer of diesel generators so when you buy a generator from cat they ll try to sell you a flywheel he explains the numbers are staggering when you look at all the generators now hooked up to batteries hammerschmidt owns shares or about percent of the company across the turner funds and he expects active to turn a profit by the third quarter of david smith who recently launched coverage of several power technology stocks at salomon smith barney likes

reporter tm asia intelligence wire new delhi april after a spell of deceleration in lending following sanctions on india in the last couple of years in the last decade the asian development bank adb is all set to make good by extending over billion by way of its country assistance programme to india in the next four years disclosing this to newspersons here a senior official from the manila based regional development bank mr klaus gerhaeusser said that for the current year the bank s lending to india would be of the order of billion including million to earthquake affected gujarat to million for power sector in madhya pradesh and an additional million for private sector participation in infrastructure million for western corridor of the prime minister s golden quadrilateral highway project and million for west bengal s metro rail project mr gerhaeusser said that from to india would get on average billion a year so that the medium term country assistance to india would reach billion beyond he said the adb officials held intensive discussion with indian government officials both at the centre and in the states during the last two weeks to wrap up the bank s medium term lending programme covering four year period he said the states under focus from the bank s point of view include madhya pradesh gujarat and kerala though during the current visit of the bank mission exploratory talks were initiated with the newly formed state government of chhattisgarh besides these states other states keen on getting lending from the adb include tamil nadu and karnataka he said adding that the bank enters into comprehensive dialogue with the respective states about the sector in which loan was being made so that reforms in this sector and overall macroeconomic position of the state could be thoroughly reviewed to make the future project lending to them sustainable alongside he said the bank discusses the tax reform expenditure management debt management including restructuring and reform of state owned enterprises he said one of the mandates of this mission is to discuss with state governments to what extent they are committed to undertake reforms and sustain them so as to qualify for continued future assistance from the bank on the loan assistance programme he said traditionally the bank supported power sector in states but now it was extended to the centre also discussions are ongoing with power finance corporation to leverage reform in other reform minded states particularly given the importance of power sector in rural electrification he said once the national highway development programme nhdp is through by the bank would start dialogue with the national highway authority of india nhai for assisting the golden quadrilateral highway corridor programme in which the bank could provide technical assistance in the form of capacity building for executing agency to prepare project preparation and logistics management mr gerhaeusser said he said the bank s offer of assistance for west bengal in the highway corridor programme was mainly due to sub regional considerations given the strategic location of the state in that area asked about whether the enron tangle would have any effect on the bank s assistance to power sector lending programme in india mr gerhaeusser said that we do not like to comment on this issue the government of maharashtra and the central government were dealing with this he however said that the bank undertakes power sector programme with the state government concerned only after thoroughly satisfying itself with various parameters of the concerned state s commitment to reform in the sector to a query about how much component of over billion loan assistance to india would comprise soft loans being extended from the bank s asian development fund adf mr kazu sakai programme manager of india at adb said that last year negotiations for fresh pledge to adf were over unfortunately both india and china were not to get this assistance so all the assistance for india would be from the bank s ordinary capital resources ocr bearing market related interest to a specific query about the bank s commitment to extend loan for restructuring indian railways mr gerhaeusser clarified that the expert committee on restructuring of indian railways had not completed its final report and there was a delay of one and a half year he said that assuming that report would be ready within the next few months it would be discussed thoroughly by all the people concerned and it is premature to talk about assistance in terms of big loans for restructuring railways he added our bureau india enron renegotiation panel announced business line the hindu copyright c kasturi sons ltd ksl source world reporter

copyright c kasturi sons ltd ksl source world reporter tm asia intelligence wire mumbai april the reliance group is closely watching and waiting the outcome of the on going controversy over enron s dabhol power project to make any further move vis a vis its patalganga power project expansion mr anil ambani managing director reliance industries said the company is waiting for the state government s decision regarding independent power producers ipps and also how the reforms in the power sector shape up they government are also saying that the state would not need the power in any case there is provision in our power purchase agreement ppa with mseb to sell power outside mr ambani said asked if reliance is interested in taking over the dabhol power company dpc he merely said the company has an open mind enron is still running dpc they are our partners in oil exploration we look at value propositions as and when they arise we have an open mind he said the mw lng based patalganga project had run into trouble when the maharashtra state electricity board mseb declined to provide escrow cover citing financial constraints the project which is yet to achieve financial close is awaiting the government s decision on the matter the energy review committee headed by dr madhav godbole had recommended in its interim report that all ppas with ipps be deferred and they also be made public neither of the two ipps reliance patalganga and ispat bhadravati are today contractually structured to meet the needs of intermediate and peaking load in either mseb or maharashtra allowing these ipps to proceed as currently structured will only result in a problem similar to dpc re emerging in future therefore the panel recommends that mseb defer all ppas with ipps and re examine them in accordance with a least cost plan and in any case till such time the demand levels in the state permit full absorption of power generation from such ipps the panel had observed our bureau enron

mumbai business standard copyright c business standard indian lenders to dabhol power company dpc led by the industrial deve lopment bank of india idbi have asked the centre to honour its counter guarantee and pay rs crore for the december bill immediately to end the impasse over the billion dabhol power company dpc project in maharashtra in a letter to finance secretary ajit kumar despatched on saturday the domestic lenders said the centre must immediately step in to defuse the crisis and save them from posting irreparable losses if enron walks out of the project this is possibly the first instance of onshore lenders moving the finance ministry to save a project this is unprecedented as a last ditch attempt the financial institutions are putting pressure on the centre to save the project and their money said a source in the ministry the lenders suspect that dpc may eventually declare itself bankrupt as the company had hinted at roping in a bankruptcy lawyer at last week s meeting in london against the backdrop of the maharashtra state electricity board mseb having defaulted on its payments the mseb s payment of rs crore under protest has not helped its cause much as dpc will classify the payment as a contingent liability in its balance sheet and may declare itself insolvent if mseb continues to pay up this way pointed out an institutional source at the london meeting the bankruptcy law issue was raised even though dpc did not clearly spell out its future course of action on this the indian lenders persuaded dpc not to go ahead with its proposal to terminate the power purchase agreement ppa against the stiff resistance of the foreign lenders but they have merely bought a three week reprieve in case the issues are not sorted out within three weeks the situation may worsen as the epc contractor bechtel may pull out if dpc fails to pay up the epc contractor may serve the pull out notice in june the government must resolve these issues on a war footing said another source familiar with developments the lenders letter to the finance ministry has listed a host of issues ranging from the delay in giving technical clearance for pollution control to dpc to honouring the centre s as well as the maharashtra government s counter guarantees it has categorically said if the project fails both foreign and indian lenders will take a hit usa

asia africa intel wire business line the hindu copyright c kasturi sons ltd all rights res d the top brass of enron the shipping corporation of india and mitsui osk line have assembled in tokyo to decide the fate of laxmi the lakh cubic metre capacity lng carrier being built in a japanese yard laxmi belongs to greenfield shipping a wholly owned subsidiary of greenfield holdings promoted by the three companies it is supposed to transport lng from oman and abu dhabi for the power plant being set up by enron s dabhol power company dpc at ratnagiri in maharashtra with enron threatening to pull out of dpc the fate of laxmi has become somewhat uncertain the objective of the tokyo meeting is two fold first the greenfield partners will review the situation arising out of enron s threat to pull out of dpc and second they will meet representatives of anz investment bank and other lenders funding acquisition of the vessel anz investment bank is the leader of the member consortium of lenders the greenfield partners have declined to give additional securities which the lenders are insisting on the lenders who have already declared an event of default in view of uncertainty over the dpc s project are believed to have threatened to hold back the payment of the last instalment amounting to million in the event of non availability of additional securities the disbursement of the last instalment is due at the time of delivery of the vessel in the middle of november anz investment bank and others in the consortium will part fund the cost of laxmi together these lenders are to provide million as loans of which million has already been disbursed the vessel will finally cost about million its core cost being million the anxiety of the lenders is understandable with enron threatening to pull out of dpc leading financial institutions and banks earlier supporting the project have already stopped releasing funds to dpc anz investment bank and other lenders therefore apprehend that dpc the charterer of the vessel might find it hard to pay the charter hire hence there is a threat to withhold the disbursement of the last instalment all these developments are taking place at a time when construction of the vessel is nearly complete the vessel is due to be delivered in november while dpc s lng based power project is due to be commissioned in end or early the greenfield partners are however not unduly worried over the probable deployment of laxmi in case the proposed lng transportation for the dpc plant comes a cropper it can be deployed on spot charter and profitably observe sources pointing out that the global trend in the past one year suggests that lng carriers are increasingly being offered on spot charters true per cent of the odd lng vessels of the world are still dedicated to certain projects but the share of lng ships on spot charter today is about five per cent up from one per cent a year ago this is considered a significant development in fact mitsui osk line which controls nearly one third of the world s total lng tonnage is believed to be confident about deploying laxmi on spot charter profitably in case it is freed from the dpc project shipping sources said several lng vessels already under construction are not tied to any project for example shell which by way of liquification regasification and transportation through stasco is associated with nearly per cent of the world s lng business has ordered four lng carriers none of them being tied to given projects the same is true about several other world leaders in the field laxmi will be delivered at a time when the demand for lng is expected to pick up as the entire western world will then be in the throes of winter that will also be the time when the charter rates for lng carriers is expected to shoot up it will be another two years or so before lng vessels currently on order are delivered till then the spot demand for lng vessels will persist it is felt however one disadvantage of spot chartering is that it might imply a certain amount of idling of vessels also one cannot be sure if the spotting will yield the same freight earning for laxmi as has been fixed for dpc the contract for lng transportation for the dpc project was signed for years at a confirmed rate of per day alternatively laxmi can be put on one year charter greenfield

copyright c dow jones company inc hardly a day went by last year without an announcement that a new electric power plant had been planned or put under construction somewhere in the u s and who could blame the utility industry for its zealous building binge politicians were wringing their hands about an energy crisis in full view of the television cameras the price of electricity was surging from montauk to malibu meanwhile all across california the seething citizenry was sitting in the dark in recent months however the blackouts have abated and the lights have come on again electric bills are falling and the politicians have moved on but the utility industry s troubles are only just beginning say several consulting firms and some candid and canny insiders the industry they fear is in the midst of a building boom that could result in a widespread financial bust by some counts the power industry plans to add as much as megawatts of generating capacity over the next six years which would represent an increase of almost to current capacity of megawatts of power at the same time the forward price curve for electric power which tracks bid and asked prices for power delivered at specified future points has been trending down this has led some industry observers to predict a power glut with potentially ugly consequences for firms that are forced to carry unused generating capacity william mccormick jr chief executive of cms energy a large electric power producer in dearborn michigan doesn t mince his words just in michigan there are megawatts of new power that are planned but probably won t be needed anytime soon he says most of this power will be generated by new plants built by so called merchant power producers which sell their output in unregulated markets if activated they would increase the margin for capacity reserved for emergencies to an unnecessarily high from a current mccormick and others believe that michigan may well be a microcosm of the nation as a whole says e linn draper jr chief executive of american electric power the largest u s power producer the question is how low the forward price curve will go and whether future power prices will allow investors in power plants to recover their outlays for new generation it is impossible to measure at this early date the aggregate financial damage that the industry might incur if its best laid plans and plants ultimately do not provide adequate returns some consultants have suggested that of the plans announced for new facilities eventually will be shelved and electricity daily a well regarded

some orders for delivery of gas turbines in but he doesn t yet view this order flow as an indicator of a trend on the other hand williamson sees signs of a pick up in orders from europe and the middle east that could partially offset what looks like a slowdown in domestic sales two or three years from now after struggling for business in the mid s ge s power systems unit has become a major contributor to the company s earnings growth segment profits more than doubled since reaching billion last year profits nearly doubled again in the first half of this year to billion from billion a year ago but the aforementioned short seller says a lot of investors will start waking up late next year and belatedly discover that a power glut isn t far off williamson says he s unaware of any order cancellations and probably wouldn t expect any for another months in accordance with the terms of most sales given the rosy long term outlook for electricity demand supply constraints eventually are bound to reappear but near term concerns about excessive generating capacity aren t all that surprising either boom and bust cycles are endemic to commodities businesses from steel to paper to power whenever there is a need and the price is right supply will rush in to meet demand by way of illustration john w rowe co chief executive of exelon a chicago based energy holding company recently testified at senate hearings on president bush s proposals to boost energy supplies rowe observed that in the five years through electric demand increased by while additions to generating capacity rose only he cited the dramatic rise in electricity prices until recently anyway as proof positive of what happens when capacity doesn t keep pace with demand the electric utility market has wrestled with overcapacity in the past but never in the memory of industry veterans has the problem loomed as large as today that s because almost no new plants were constructed in recent years as the industry coped with the fallout from deregulation the wholesale market was deregulated six years ago by federal decree and the industry has been further liberated on a state by state basis since but the process was marked by political wrangling between consumer and other special interest groups and the outlook remained uncertain in many parts of the country until fairly recently the upshot was a general reluctance industrywide to commit to large capacity expansions as a result the regulated utilities erected only a few power plants over a five year span this paved the way for several independent generators of power to thrive and in the past two years catapulted the leaders in that market aes and calpine into the growth stock leagues calpine in particular achieved star status and its shares quadrupled as the san jose company s earnings soared last year calpine posted earnings of million or a share on revenues of billion compared with net of million or cents a share on million in revenues in in the latest quarter earnings more than doubled to million or cents a share while revenues more than tripled to billion yet investors no longer seem quite as dazzled by the company s plans to build or acquire up to megawatts of capacity by which would represent a fold increase over current capacity of megawatts of power calpine too must recognize that its ambitious plans could face some roadblocks ahead recently the company has turned much of its attention to expanding outside this country in places such as the united kingdom and canada if calpine manages to realize its goals however the company could become one of the largest if not the largest u s power generator it would be the leader of a spunky pack of merchant power producers although it currently lacks the extensive power marketing operations of some others in the field many regulated utilities also have been captivated by the potential for profits from wholesale and trading activities some frankly trumpet the wholesale trading of power as their main growth initiative and a few have spun off or otherwise separated for operating purposes their unregulated operations mirant a former subsidiary of southern came public last september and after a rough start its shares spiked up to from the stock now trades around other prominent independents include reliant resources spun out of reliant energy in may nrg energy an offshoot of xcel energy and aquila which was recently taken public by parent utilicorp other power providers including industry giants duke energy and american electric power have been contemplating similar spinoffs in part the independents are hoping to emulate enron one of the largest traders of wholesale power while brokerage analysts generally have applauded the utilities drive to exploit wholesale trading some are now growing wary about the possible financial consequences of an energy glut that s because a recent and unexpectedly sharp decline in power prices has raised red flags about the industry s future earnings from the sale of wholesale power according to statistics compiled for barron s by mcgraw hill platts a prominent trade publisher wholesale electric prices nationwide have dropped to less than per megawatt hour and in some areas to from about in may late last year power in california fetched a stunning per megawatt hour while the national average soared above in december in part it was this sort of price action that spurred orders for new plants as merchant power producers and others envisioned printing money the forward price curve which peaked in early april tells a similarly sobering tale according to platts the cost of power bought in the mid atlantic region for delivery in then sold for about per megawatt hour the price since has fallen to power for would have cost per megawatt hour and now it s in the main hub in california meanwhile power for has fallen to from an april high of two weeks ago raymond niles a utility analyst at salomon smith barney issued a cautionary note about power prices noting that june was the first month this year to show a year to year decline in electric prices and a violent one at that niles sees worsening comparisons ahead which prompted him to cut his earnings estimates and price targets for several utilities including entergy xcel and utilicorp steve fleishman of merrill lynch long considered one of the top utility analysts also has begun to acknowledge a potential power glut but he s quick to give the weather and economy their due in guiding supply and demand by fleishman s reckoning megawatts of new capacity will be added to the market next year but demand has been dampened by a weak economy lower power prices stemming in part from federally imposed price caps in california and cooler summer weather throughout the u s which has led to cutbacks in air conditioning loads fleishman maintains power prices may get weaker still before rebounding lowell miller a money manager specializing in utility shares thinks the stocks are still vulnerable precisely because they were accorded glamour status by some fans on the street once considered the province of risk averse investors they migrated last year into the hands of the growth oriented crowd ruth ann gillis the chief financial officer of exelon concurs the company s stock recently dropped more than five points in two days even after the company which was formed by the merger of philadelphia s peco energy and chicago based unicom posted strong second quarter earnings and predicted further gains the momentum crowd took over the trading in utility shares after dumping technology stocks she says now they may be getting out the managers of the nation s biggest electric utilities are mixed in their assessments of the threat of a power glut and in their tactics to combat it linn draper of aep sticks by what he calls a contrarian view about new generation aep he notes is meeting increased demand through its merger with central south west which was completed in june and is increasing its operating efficiency by upgrading equipment and procedures the company has entered into joint ventures with chemical companies for new plants but draper emphasizes that aep has refrained from building new plants on its own initially he says the company s wall street followers failed to appreciate why the utility didn t follow the trail blazed by more aggressive producers such as calpine duke and mirant but with power prices falling draper feels that aep s stance will be vindicated the company based its predictions for future supply and demand on both published price curves and its own internal analysis he notes draper s on the same page as the rest of the industry however in viewing the wholesaling and trading of unregulated power as the best avenue to earnings growth in addition to being the nation s largest electric power producer with nearly megawatts of capacity aep claims it s no behind enron in trading electric power and gas the bulk of the growth in the company s second quarter earnings which totaled million or cents a share came from wholesale electric and gas operations aep expects to earn for the full year and in duke energy another giant in electric and gas operations has taken a somewhat more aggressive stance than aep in capacity additions richard b priory the company s chief executive doesn t seem surprised by the industry s aggressive building plans given that many utilities several years back were too paralyzed by the problems surrounding deregulation to respond to an obvious impending shortage of power a lot of executives had their heads in the sand he says duke is still expansion minded with a number of new power plants on its books priory seems reassured by the growing contributions of wholesale electric power and gas to the company s earnings stream wholesaling drove second quarter earnings up and contributed to a gain in revenue in the year s first half the company expects to earn billion or a share for the year compared with a share in still priory is keeping an eye on industry supply and says duke could curtail construction if necessary over the next three to five years we re likely to see an easing of currently tight markets and that could mean some new plants that have been announced don t get built he says the company canceled orders for two small peaker plants earlier this year but still plans to add around megawatts of capacity by the end of in recent years the utility industry has been partially reconfigured by several big mergers and further consolidations might radically alter the outlook for power supply and demand it is hard to handicap the prospects for more deals however because proposed mergers often risk substantial regulatory and other delays the electric industry has mounted a protracted effort to obtain congressional repeal of the public utility holding company act a relic of the great depression that was designed to halt consolidation utility executives have speculated that outright repeal would unleash a tidal wave of mergers among the roughly four score publicly traded firms that in turn conceivably would lead to plant consolidations and diminished need for additional plant capacity completed and pending mergers between electric power producers and natural gas pipeline companies also might mitigate the need for some new power plants in the long term the development of alternative energy sources such as solar and wind based power also could curb construction of coal and gas fired electric power plants the supply of natural gas in itself might alter the utility industry s future building plans many independent oil and gas producers stepped up drilling last year as energy prices rose but christopher r ellinghaus energy analyst with williams capital group a new york investment bank recently predicted a third of the new power plants planned in the u s won t be completed because of a shortage of gas ellinghaus thinks contraints on the supply of electric power will be eased for the next few years but anticipates a much tighter market thereafter unless an unprecedented amount of new gas is produced in three to five years the bush administration which took office in the midst of california s energy crisis isn t banking entirely on gas fired plants but pushing for the expanded use of coal and nuclear power in recent years however it has been tough to obtain regulatory approval for new coal powered plants despite much progress in developing so called cleaner coal industry groups have been pressuring the white house to lower environmental standards in order to speed coal mine development and coal executives now seem jubilant about the prospects for success the industry notes that coal fired plants generating more than megawatts of power are now in the planning or development stages similarly the nuclear power industry is flexing its muscles again thanks in part to encouraging words from president bush nuclear plants which now supply of the nation s electric power fell into disrepute after accidents at three mile island in pennsylvania and chernobyl in russia but the operating records of most of the nuclear plants in the u s since have improved and the industry is determined to speed up the license renewal process building a new nuclear plantwould take several years but some in the industry are looking to newly designed models that require shorter lead times in the meantime plans continue apace for the industry s build out of more gas and coal fired plants but unless demand for power increases at a similar clip their output will go begging company earnings will suffer and investors will find little reason to fall in love with utilities all over again copyright dow jones company inc all rights reserved software companies face uphill battle in bid to shift from one time sales fees to monthly subscriptions by michael liedtke ap business writer associated press newswires copyright the associated press all rights reserved san francisco ap oracle corp built an billion dollar a year business selling and installing software on computers but ceo larry ellison thinks those days are ending five years from now ellison believes oracle will generate most of its revenue renting its products in a world wired to the internet under this scenario businesses and eventually consumers will go online to log on to a web site and pay a monthly fee for access to a wide variety of applications instead of buying a disk and installing the software on a single computer s hard drive the transition is a no brainer in ellison s mind because businesses will save money hiring consultants to handle the tedious process of installing software on in house computers and their employees will have the flexibility to access applications from just about anywhere using laptops and handheld devices meanwhile redwood shores based oracle will build a more reliable revenue stream akin to a cash rich cable tv company that collects subscriptions from a captive audience month after month i believe all software companies will transform themselves into online service companies we have no choice ellison said earlier this summer even longtime ellison nemesis microsoft corp is heading down the same path as oracle as part of a new internet initiative unveiled last year the redmond wash based company is introducing a new service called hailstorm which will enable businesses and consumers to rent a variety of online applications for a monthly fee despite the resolve of the world s two biggest software companies online software rentals seem like a pipe dream to many industry executives and analysts large companies are never going to trust someone else to run their software if you believe technology is your most precious asset you are not going to let go of it said peoplesoft inc ceo craig conway every year it seems like there is some major paradigm shift predicted for the industry sometimes they actually happen but most of the time they don t ellison certainly missed the mark with one of his most heralded predictions of sweeping technological change in the mid s ellison made worldwide headlines by unveiling a network company that would draw upon online resources and make microsoft s windows based operating system obsolete ellison s vision hasn t panned out yet and most analysts believe he is shooting too high again with his ambitious predictions for online software services it s going to be a very gradual evolution if it occurs at all said industry analyst charles phillips of morgan stanley dean witter in new york people like to have control over their own technology they like to build it themselves they want to be able to see it in a room security concerns and worries about system outages also might discourage online software subscriptions software companies like oracle and microsoft are pushing to build online subscription businesses because they are beginning to recognize the growth limitations of their traditional sales approach phillips said both companies are reaching such a saturation point with their software that they realize there is only so much more money they can make from one time fees for new products and upgrades a breed of companies known as application service providers have been struggling terribly in their efforts to rent software online the most prominent pure asps include annapolis md based usinternetworking inc and san mateo based corio inc which have lost million and million respectively since their inceptions in while attracting fewer than customers combined reflecting their grim outlook the stocks of both companies are stuck under per share usinternetworking went public in april at per share while corio made its stock market debut in july at per share despite the early troubles of pioneering asps the research firm international data corp sees a bright future for the concept in a recent report idc predicted total asp revenues will swell from million last year to billion in proponents of online software rentals say the asps have flopped because they are leasing applications made by outsiders such as peoplesoft sap and siebel systems the only companies that will be successful in delivering online services will be the software companies themselves ellison predicts everyone else that tries to deliver online services will fail marc benioff one of ellison s former lieutenants at oracle says his san francisco based start up is proof that online software subscriptions are the wave of the future since going online in march salesforce com has signed up employees at companies that pay per monthly subscriber we are going great guns benioff said the internet has matured to the point that it is more than capable of handling this kind of model backed by million in venture capital privately held salesforce com is projecting revenues of million this year nearly quadrupling last year s sales of million the company expects to become profitable early next year when its revenues are expected to hit million analysts say salesforce has proven that online subscription software works for certain people like on the go sales representatives and for small and medium sized companies that might not have the budget or time to install complex software applications the skeptics doubt large corporations will depend on cookie cutter online subscription services for complex applications critical to their day to day applications this is fine for the small guys that don t want to be bothered with technology but the big companies want to be masters of their own destiny said industry analyst joe outlaw of the gartner group in stamford conn after using salesforce s service for four months energy giant enron corp s director of sales john hillman is convinced online subscription is the way to go for software applications i

blame for california s power crisis and neither are electricity wholesalers a texas energy executive told a crowd at the commonwealth club of california on thursday evening jeffrey skilling ceo and president of houston based enron corp wiped away the remnants of a pie hurled by a protester and placed the blame squarely on california s energy regulators the state public utilities commission in the early s put together a broken market by preventing utilities to pass along the full cost of power and discouraging power contracts that would have lowered dependence on buying last minute power skilling said the regulators are now the people to whom californians are turning to solve the problem skilling said because of these rules the power consumers of the state of california were thrown totally to the mercy of the spot market puc president loretta lynch defended the regulators actions last week saying utilities have been free to enter into long term contracts utilities countered that the puc never made clear what contracts it would accept which left open the possibility they would later be overruled enron has come under fire after accusations from davis and state officials that it and other energy companies forced electricity prices skyward by holding back supply enron denies such claims and joins other power producers in arguing that the state and utilities still owe them billions in unpaid bills davis acknowledges that pacific gas electric which has declared bankruptcy and southern california edison together still owe generators such as enron duke energy mirant and reliant energy about billion for past electricity sales state officials counter that wholesalers charged as much as billion in illegal overcharges dating back to may the feuding groups are to meet in a single room next week under a federal order to try and work out agreements that could determine how billions of dollars will be divided companies have said california s claims are wildly exaggerated the federal energy regulatory commission has already estimated that wholesalers owe california million in overcharges for the first four months of the year davis and others say that s a mere drop in the bucket enron has also been tied to president bush s hands off approach to the energy crisis company chairman kenneth lay is a friend and one of bush s largest campaign contributors several prominent members of the bush administration hold stock in the company enron is one of several major gop donors accused of meeting secretly with vice president dick cheney as he drafted the bush administration s energy plan in may lay met secretly with california republicans at the beverly hills hotel and pushed a plan that called for ratepayers to pay the billions in debt racked up by the state s public utilities the plan contended that federal investigations of price gouging are hindering the situation the meeting drew such names as movie star arnold schwarzenegger los angeles mayor

communications companies with billion in revenues in it owns miles of pipeline has employees and is active in countries during the first quarter of this year enron s revenues increased percent to billion new plants to generate electricity within weeks increase in supply reduces threat of summer blackouts by ed mendel union tribune staff writer june sacramento gov gray davis said yesterday that three new power plants will begin operating within days giving california its first new major generators in more than a decade and easing the threat of blackouts this summer news about the plants comes on the heels of other developments about conservation and additional power supply that have given state officials increasing confidence in california s ability to survive the power crisis this summer optimistically said davis our conservation and generation effort will help us minimize any disruptions this summer one of the new plants was scheduled to begin operating in august but instead will come on line wednesday edison international s sunrise plant near bakersfield will supply megawatts a megawatt can provide enough power for to households in addition to the edison facility calpine will open its megawatt sutter plant near yuba city on july and its megawatt los medanos plant near pittsburg days later both plants are expected to open according to schedule in the next days we will put more power on line than california did in the last years davis said during the past decade the governor said the state added less than megawatts with a number of small power plants despite population growth and increased power demand from the high tech industry the fast track modernization of a megawatt huntington beach plant is expected by late august the plant was shut down about five years ago by september davis said the addition of eight to small plants that operate during peak load periods as well as increased power from a variety of other small generators will raise the total of new power coming this summer to megawatts as further protection against blackouts state power buyers revealed last week that in recent months they have been able to send some surplus electricity to a canadian utility bc hydro which will return the power in july and august despite efforts to increase the state s energy supply this summer more ultimately will be needed california has been importing about percent of its power in recent years even though about a dozen power plants are approved or under construction davis does not expect supply to match demand until late until then the state will need surplus electricity generation to make the deregulated market work properly experts say davis has said in the past that california should add megawatts of power generation in the years ahead a new state power authority has been created that could construct or buy power plants if the private sector does not build a surplus of electricity generation also state officials suggest the trend among californians to conserve electricity may grow the state is spending million on conservation programs including funding for energy efficient equipment and an advertising campaign the program gives refunds to customers who dramatically reduce their electricity consumption this summer state officials also expect electricity use to be reduced by sticker shock from rate increases beginning this month for edison and pacific gas and electric customers ratepayers are exempt from the increase if they use percent or less of the baseline level of electricity a minimal amount that varies with regional climate zones a proposal to increase rates for san diego gas electric customers is pending before the state public utilities commission in addition to announcing the new plants davis yesterday reiterated his demand that california deserves billion in refunds from overcharges by power companies that issue will be the subject of mediation sessions that begin today in washington when the federal energy regulatory commission imposed regional price limits last week the regulators asked an administrative law judge to recommend possible refunds by generators for overcharging davis said the california negotiating team will be led by michael kahn chairman of the independent system operator which runs the state s electricity grid davis said kahn s team will present information supporting california s claim of overcharging the administrative law judge curtis wagner jr suggested last week that california may be owed a smaller amount billion to billion the governor sent wagner a brief letter replying to the judge s request for a list of issues that should be considered in the conference our list is short davis said in the letter the conference must address the need to have ferc order power sellers to refund the estimated billion they have overcharged the people of the state of california while that session is taking place davis today plans to meet in sacramento with president bush s two new appointees to the five member ferc pat wood iii of texas and nora brownell of pennsylvania davis said that when he met with the president last month bush agreed to send wood to california to investigate natural gas prices which are several times higher in california than in new york we agreed that there is no explanation for the disparity of prices between california and new york when it comes to natural gas davis said we agreed that was wrong the governor also said he will meet this morning with three former employees of duke energy s chula vista power plant who have accused the company of altering the plant s output to boost power prices the employees last week told a state senate committee that they were ordered to reduce power during peak load periods and throw away good replacement parts which sometimes delayed maintenance there may be another side to the story davis said but these three employees worked years had no reason to mislead the state senate and they testified under oath duke denied wrongdoing and said power was reduced at the request of the agency that runs the power grid the independent system operator a davis spokesman said yesterday that he did not know if the former employees could qualify for a reward in april state attorney general bill lockyer announced a whistle blower reward for information on price gouging by power generators lockyer said the reward would be based on a percentage of what the state recovers as a result of the information he said the reward could be worth million or more lucky redding has energy to spare by steve schmidt union tribune staff writer june redding how weird is this folks in this hilly city have electricity to spare pay little for it and will pay even less next year when it comes to the state s year old energy fiasco this northern california community is an island and we feel very fortunate says violet klaseen who has lived here years electricity rates in the san diego area could climb an average percent this summer the state s largest utility pacific gas and electric is in bankruptcy court and an energy gap could spark more rolling blackouts across the state come hot weather not here redding runs its own power company redding electric utility operates outside the state s strained energy grid it s also one of the few city run utilities in california with spare power to sell the company s wholesale revenues have doubled in the last year from sales to other utilities and the state how did this working class town near mount shasta get in this enviable position was it business savvy luck it was a combination of things says utility director james feider first came pain some utilities trimmed rates in the late s as the state moved to deregulate the energy market but redding electric raised rates percent to pay off million in power plant debt and other costs customers came unglued bills rose from cents per kilowatt hour to more than a dime today it s pocket money customers of san diego gas electric co pay an average cents per kilowatt hour that figure is expected to climb in coming weeks pg e customers pay an average cents among the highest rates in the nation redding s rate will return to cents next year once the utility pays off most debts the company serves the city s residents the utility is also focused on the future while many other agencies scramble to meet short term demands redding electric is expanding capacity of its natural gas fired power plant by about percent when the project is finished next year redding will produce more than half of its own electricity enron corp the nation s biggest electricity trader will also supply energy to the city utility at cents per kilowatt hour enron and redding electric struck the deal last fall before prices went from high to astronomical redding electric is unusual among city run power companies in california because it has no direct ties to the major utilities we ve made some good strategic decisions says feider who has run the outfit since he s also president of the california municipal utilities association gov gray davis recently blasted municipal power companies accusing them of selling energy to the state at rip off prices he threatened to seize their electricity saying we re going to get that power one way or another the governor said city run companies have charged the state percent more than the average price demanded by private generators but feider says the governor was out of line feider says redding electric could have sold its power elsewhere for more profit one of the governor s top energy advisers has said outfits such as redding electric have played fair with the state feider also says his utility needed to boost its sales price to cover the skyrocketing cost of natural gas we re willing to be cooperative and bend over backward and here we get attacked by the governor he says redding officials stress the hometown customers come first i don t think we owe the rest of the state anything says council member pat kight on the other hand we don t want to be isolationists up here we want to be good neighbors redding provided the state with power late last year to help california avoid blackouts but it stopped selling to the state in january after state grid operators didn t pay a million bill redding is willing to help in a pinch if the state can guarantee payment the utility also preaches conservation despite having power to spare energy usage is down about percent in the city on the northern end of california s central valley the company was created in there are about city run electric utilities in the state including in sacramento los angeles palo alto and santa clara some experts say municipal utilities have advantages over other power providers their operating costs tend to be lower and they have easier access to electricity generated by the federal government city utilities were also exempted from california s now failed deregulation law that turns out to be a big advantage says bill ahern an energy analyst with the national consumers union now there s talk in sacramento of boosting state government oversight of city utilities i d prefer they d leave us alone feider says we ve done fine on our own billion in rebates not good enough davis says associated press june san diego as an array of officials prepared to represent california in federally ordered talks with power companies gov gray davis on sunday discounted suggestions that the state will accept far less in electricity rebates than he believes it s owed we re going back to washington with one goal and that s to get back billion davis said from san diego in a telephone conference with reporters california officials contend that power generators have overcharged the state and investor owned utilities utilities billion since last may the companies argue that the charges which have reached as high as a megawatt hour were justified power providers have been taking advantage of our market they gamed the system and ripped people off davis said on monday officials from the state the utilities and the generators meet under orders from the federal energy regulatory commission to negotiate a settlement over the alleged overcharges the talks will be overseen by curtis wagner jr ferc s chief administrative law judge wagner said friday that he was optimistic a settlement would be reached but thought the amount would be closer to billion or billion davis said michael kahn chairman of the california independent system operator which manages the state s power grid will lead california s negotiating team also taking part in the talks will be representatives of the attorney general s office the public utilities commission and the department of water resources ferc has authority only over private power generators but the state claims it also was overcharged by public entities such as the los angeles department of water and power and the trading arm of canada s bc hydro davis senior adviser nancy mcfadden said a settlement with the private generators would give the state leverage with the others we need to use the forum that we ve got available to us she said davis said the state will get a little more breathing room in the power grid over the next two and a half weeks when three new power plants producing a total of nearly megawatts are scheduled to go on line a megawatt plant near bakersfield is set to begin operating wednesday and will be followed by a megawatt plant near yuba city and a megawatt plant in contra costa county the addition this summer of major power plants smaller peaker plants and cleaner burning qualifying facilities should add megawatts to the state s overburdened power grid by sept davis said that expansion and ongoing conservation efforts will reduce the chances of rolling blackouts he said davis also said that he will meet monday with three former employees of one power generator duke energy who testified before a california senate committee friday the former employees who were laid off in april say they were told to shut units down for unnecessary repairs in a scheme to drive up electricity prices the company called the claims baseless port urged to seize chula vista plant ex employees tell state senate panel duke rigged prices by bill ainsworth union tribune staff writer june sacramento two former mechanics at duke energy s chula vista power plant said yesterday that the company s operation and maintenance policies were so shoddy and reckless that duke may have violated its lease with the san diego unified port district those accusations made before a legislative committee prompted sen steve peace to urge the port to nullify duke s lease and take back the plant which provides the company with huge profits the port district owns the plant but in entered an agreement that allowed duke to operate it for years the port has all the leverage said peace d chula vista they just have to exercise it port officials yesterday declined to comment on whether this testimony would spark an attempt to take control of the plant the mechanics were part of a trio of former south bay power plant veterans who repeated their explosive claims initially made public thursday that duke repeatedly throttled down generators to create power shortages to drive up prices even during energy emergencies their appearance before the state senate select committee to investigate price manipulation received national media coverage their accusations could provide the first inside evidence that power companies withheld electricity to increase their profits a practice state officials claim has cost consumers billions of dollars duke officials denied all the accusations saying the ex employees do not understand the complexities of running a power plant even though all three worked at the chula vista facility for some years further company officials said the plant has compiled an exemplary record of staying in production we ve exceeded all our peers in north america said bill hall vice president for western regional operations for duke energy a north carolina based company that owns three other power plants in california duke officials will be allowed to testify at a future hearing of the committee at one point during yesterday s hearing peace read from the lease that allows duke to run the megawatt south bay plant it requires duke to operate and maintain the plant according to prudent utility practices peace asked the mechanics whether duke met these standards both mechanics ed edwards jr and glenn johnson said no it s prudent to making money johnson said of duke s practices it s not prudent to operating it safely the mechanics said duke powered the turbines up and down so often the equipment was in jeopardy of breaking down they also testified that supervisors required them to throw away new spare parts a practice they believe led to longer outages because they had to keep generators offline while more parts were ordered johnson testified that duke reduced the maintenance staff at the south bay plant to seven or eight mechanics from he said when he started with sdg e the company took special pride in careful maintenance policies designed to keep the equipment operating smoothly that all changed he said under deregulation it changed even more when duke took control of the plant about april we were told we were no longer a family johnson said we were a business and the business was lucrative company officials had told the former employees even before prices started soaring last year about three months after the company took over the lease in april duke held a party at which plant manager tom guthrie told workers the plant had made as much money in three months as the company had expected in a year according to the former employees last year the company held a similar party to mark the first anniversary of the lease executives again were ecstatic they told workers they had made as much money in the first year as they had expected to make in five years the former employees testified the company s prosperity has continued during the first quarter of this year duke reported that profits increased percent from energy sales and trading johnson also testified that guthrie had told employees they weren t in the electricity business but the money making business as a result he said if duke could make more money selling the natural gas that powers the electricity turbines the company would shut the turbines down guthrie s comments seem to contradict the plant s status as a must run plant that is required to take direction from the independent system operator which manages the state s electricity grid attorney michael aguirre who has criticized the duke lease as a sweetheart deal said he hopes the new information will help the public gain control of the south bay plant aguirre is suing duke and other power companies and he persuaded the former plant employees to testify it s huge because this means we can take back the plant he said we can operate the plant for the people of san diego and lower utility bills hall the duke vice president said he does not expect the testimony to lead to a challenge of the lease we re meeting all the contractual obligations with the port of san diego he said we expect to be there for the duration of the agreement port commissioner paul speer yesterday said it was premature to discuss voiding the lease during the first two years of the lease duke was required to retain all the sdg e employees the three former employees who testified yesterday including plant operator jimmy olkjer were among the workers that duke chose not to rehire in april when the company gained full control over plant employees johnson yesterday provided new evidence that duke withheld power to create a shortage that would produce bigger profits he said perfectly functioning steam turbines frequently would be powered down even during times of high demand when he asked why the units were taken offline he said supervisors told him they were down for economics sometimes a unit would be down for economics for two or three days sometimes it would be down for two weeks he said in my opinion it was down to boost prices duke officials denied they withheld power to manipulate prices they say the chula vista plant powered up and down to help balance the state s electricity grid that is to make sure demand met supply hall did say that sometimes the chula vista plant would alter its output in response to the energy market there are times when all the units aren t needed in the marketplace he said a state report released in march accused the company of withholding power percent of the time last year from may to november to drive up prices recently the federal energy regulatory commission ordered the company to pay a million refund on power it sold to the state at per megawatt hour by comparison power on the spot market is now selling for between and per megawatt hour it was selling for about about one year ago the company previously had been ordered by federal officials to refund million in overcharges the state senate committee chaired by joseph dunn d laguna niguel made a point of highlighting the heroic military backgrounds of two of the former plant employees olkjer received five purple hearts for wounds in vietnam and during a break in the hearing johnson went up to the ornate chambers of the senate to receive a medal of valor he was awarded by the national guard but had not received johnson earned the medal the state s highest military honor in when he and two colleagues in the guard risked their lives to dispose of dynamite they found while fighting a brush fire gov gray davis plans to meet with the former power plant workers monday california metro desk demand had minor role in power crisis electricity consumption has been predictable and rose less quickly than in other western states but supply grew hardly at all and reserves melted away robin fields los angeles times home edition page b copyright the times mirror company california has been depicted as a power addict whose growing habit led inexorably to the crisis that has roiled the state since may yet the state s electricity yen is the wrong target for blame the least volatile and least decisive piece of a larger puzzle an analysis of consumption patterns shows california consumption has been as regular as a heartbeat in the last decade sloping upward gently with a blip each summer in the last year demand s predictability made it the lone calm spot within a hailstorm of dizzying price peaks and supply lurches moreover california s power consumption increased far less than that of its western neighbors on whose excess supply it had come to depend yes demand grew in california but what people who have that discussion ignore is that demand in the rest of the west grew even faster said severin borenstein director of the uc energy institute in berkeley we re all part of the same grid within the complex sometimes murky power picture demand was a problem hiding in plain sight starting in energy agencies began to warn that its slow swell coupled with stagnant supply had left california with wafer thin power reserves in retrospect these agencies say deregulation left them powerless to prevent the impending collision between supply and demand when they hit head on last summer the amount of power used day to day by californians often had no relationship to the periods when the state experienced blackouts or the highest wholesale prices analysts said in the last years california s power consumption has moved subtly never advancing more than a year and even at its height lagging behind such other measures as job growth and economic output in the early s recession savaged heavy duty power users ranging from manufacturers to agricultural interests to the aerospace industry the industrial sector s usage actually declined from to overall consumption inched up so slowly in the decade s first half just that demand was of little concern as policymakers assembled the mechanisms of deregulation current and former industry officials say the system s reserve cushion the extra supply available at peak times was estimated in at a robust to without a single electron imported from beyond california s borders with pressure off utilities shifted resources out of programs promoting conservation and redistributing peak hour consumption instead they focused on new technologies that had little immediate payoff there was less emphasis on demand management said barbara barkovitch an oakland based consultant who served on the california independent system operator s board from its formation in until last june there was nothing nefarious about it but people always assume the future will be like the present as the economy rebounded consumption growth averaged about a year that slight escalation which fell within the expectations of forecasters at the california energy commission took on out sized significance because it occurred as supply stagnated the problem was not one of demand in isolation but that our demand kept growing steadily supply did not grow much at all and the gap just shrank progressively said ahmad faruqui the palo alto based electric power research institute s area manager for retail and power markets regionally the expansion was uneven weighted toward the fast developing san diego area and northern california s tech corridor consumption in san diego gas electric s service area rose more than from to and for the decade increased almost twice as much as in the state overall the commercial sector s usage grew twice as fast in the decade s last five years as it had in its first half as the economic mix shifted toward services and offices loaded up on energy eating technology the heady affluence of the late s also inflated residential consumption consumers splurged on bigger houses pools and spas more appliances and up to the minute gadgetry said sean randolph president of the bay area economic forum fixed retail prices meant consumers had little incentive to rein themselves in analysts said we decided we were not going to have a process for adjustment on the demand side borenstein said we relied entirely on the supply side and that turned out to be a huge mistake still even as consumption grew businesses became more efficient measured per capita california s consumption remained modest compared to that of less efficient more weather intensive states but gradually and quietly the system s reserve margin shrank to by a third or less than they had been at their fattest even that depended heavily on seasonal help from the other states that share california s grid help they were increasingly less able to give electricity consumption in arizona colorado and utah grew at about twice california s rate from to it expanded three times as fast in nevada in these states too supply did not keep up the collapse that started in may could have begun a year earlier if not for cool weather and plentiful rain yielding cascades of pacific northwest hydroelectric power at least six state regional and federal energy agencies issued reports from late to early warning that california s reserve margin had shriveled that help from other western states might decrease and that the state was one hot summer away from disaster the arizona new mexico southern nevada and the california mexico areas of the western transmission grid may not have adequate resources to accommodate a widespread severe heat wave or a higher than normal forced outage rate for generation wrote the north american electric reliability council in its june summer assessment those areas are experiencing a continuing trend of peak demand growth exceeding the addition of new generation facilities but in the deregulated system regulators no longer had a decisive hand in balancing supply and demand officials at the california energy commission say even analyzing the situation became harder as utilities became less methodical in submitting their consumption data things got sloppier said michael jaske the commission s chief forecaster since the utilities started letting that stuff slide poorer data was coming in to us and our management wasn t going after them the same way marketplace incentives were supposed to replace government control but new supply did not materialize even though rising demand had created a clear cut opportunity private generators say the system s uncertainties plus california s environmental fervor and slow regulatory process prevented the market from working borenstein s assessment is blunt the reason that no one built power plants was that no one thought you could make money at it ultimately the flurry of studies predicting an oncoming crisis circulated among regulators and power industry insiders but prompted little urgency when it came to curtailing demand the davis administration focused on supply instead taking steps to expedite the approval process for power plants davis spokesman steve maviglio said hindsight is always he said we weren t having blackouts in so it didn t pop up on anyone s radar summer took care of that hitting like a sonic boom hot weather caused consumption to jump almost year over year double the decade long average peak demand from may through august was consistently about higher than in summer averaging an extra megawatts per day enough to power more than million homes on aug the day with the year s highest peak cal iso s so called spinning reserve the amount of capacity that can be brought on line within minutes was the causal link between heightened usage and other pressure signals from higher spot market prices to staged emergencies seemed clear or was it peak demand still fluctuated within a narrow range only marginally above long standing forecasts the so called superpeak the moment of highest usage on summer s most brutal day was lower than in uneventful moreover after summer s heat ebbed california s consumption tapered still the power crisis other symptoms raged on in november and december wholesale power prices soared california paid far more for natural gas than the rest of the nation and the first rolling blackouts hit yet peak demand traced an almost identical line as it had the year before averaging a few megawatts less peak demand was down again from january to april when rolling blackouts returned averaging about megawatts less than in the same stretch of which passed without a single emergency state officials were quick to blame suppliers but many industry analysts point to the region wide supply demand equation these forces may continue to dominate they acknowledge even though californians have cut back on consumption faster and more this year than state officials had dared to hope in may peak demand dropped below its level and consumption fell marking the fifth straight month of reductions begin text of infobox infographic electricity demand electricity use in california has shown no dramatic shifts over the last

cover framing a shiny white light switch by the door you can t miss it leaving the room that s for the people who have trouble turning off lights she says bowen a marina del rey democrat and environmental lawyer represents the good side of term limits conscientious and cutting edge she replaced a termed out octogenarian senator ralph dills first elected to the legislature in the great depression since coming to the assembly in bowen has focused on environmental protection foster children and high tech most recently trying unsuccessfully to guard the privacy of internet consumers but now like the legislature itself she s bogged down with an all consuming issue that won t go away the senator has been thrust into the middle of a tangled energy mess she and other lawmakers unwittingly helped create with their lemming like votes five years ago this time however bowen is a major player as head of the senate energy committee something must be going right i note we haven t had any of those rolling blackouts everybody had predicted for june my biggest concern she replies sitting in the twilight is that we re being fooled right now because of the early snowmelt we ve got more power than we need hydroelectric power being generated by the sierra runoff she explains is being sent to british columbia bc is using the california power and keeping its own water stored behind dams later in summer as this state runs dry bc will generate hydro and send it to us thus every kilowatt california saves today can be banked in canada and later withdrawn during tough times i don t want people to get the idea that just because we haven t had stage s or blackouts we shouldn t be concerned bowen says we re still going to be short power this summer but how do you expect jane citizen to figure all this out especially when joe and janice legislator are having such a difficult time there is one vexing problem still facing the legislature on energy it has passed bills promoting conservation expediting power plant construction authorizing the state to sign long term contracts for wholesale electricity creating a state power authority and approving bond sales to finance it all what s left is how and whether to save southern cal edison from bankruptcy the legislature faces an aug deadline to approve a memo of understanding between gov gray davis and edison after that the mou presumably goes poof and edison collapses but the legislature has a cocky way of ignoring and testing deadlines right now there must be ideas about how to handle edison decision making is diffused bowen s energy committee for example is just one of three that is holding senate hearings on the edison bailout there s not much consensus she acknowledges the governor s proposed edison rescue involves state purchase of the utility s transmission lines for about billion democrats seem ambivalent and republicans are opposed long ago the mou was diagnosed as doa senate leader john burton d san francisco the most powerful legislator thinks the mou is a giveaway to edison in the assembly speaker bob hertzberg d sherman oaks has been pushing a unique alternative he believes could also work for pg e now struggling in bankruptcy court under his plan only the core residential and small business users would be served by private utilities electricity would be generated by the utilities themselves and regulated by the public utilities commission like the good old days before disastrous deregulation the noncore big power users who wanted deregulation in the first place would buy electricity directly from the generators and marketers presumably at a savings they re the ones who brought this on us hertzberg says but he adds there s a billion moving parts and they re not fitting well for one there may not be enough power to buy directly now that the state has cornered so much in long term contracts bowen is one of the better ones but not even she is sure what the legislature s next step should be we don t have a lot of room to move she says nor a lot of time if edison goes bankrupt it truly will be a dark day in the capitol california metro desk the state power regulators to determine state refunds energy generators and california officials will work together for days to solve the huge mathematical problem megan garvey los angeles times home edition page b copyright the times mirror company washington starting today federal power regulators will begin trying to solve one of the riddles of the energy crisis how much of a refund will california get one thing seems clear the reduction will be a lot more than the million refund ordered to date in all likelihood soaring to more than billion over the next days the federal energy regulatory commission is mandating no weekends off warring representatives from power companies and the state of california will sit at the same table in a government conference room while a ferc task force wrestles the question to the ground the task is to determine the price that power would have cost if ferc s decision to impose soft caps had been made not last week but last fall it is a daunting mathematical problem factoring in hourly charges during the last eight months to come up with a total federal regulators state electricity officials and power generators must determine what the highest price for a megawatt should have been under the soft price caps now in effect then they have to figure out which companies if any were charging more under the recent ferc ruling the price of electricity during any given hour cannot exceed the actual cost of generating the least efficient or most expensive power coming into the grid curtis l wagner the year old chief judge for ferc who is overseeing negotiations on california s overcharges said of this morning s events it will be a zoo wagner who headed into the weekend with three inches of documents to sort through explained that gov gray davis wants billion knocked off the amount the power generators charged california i don t really think it s that high said wagner predicting the refund will be more than billion but probably far from billion we have folks trying to do some adding now and some work on what the number should be he said wagner said the money at stake will be the most he has worked on in his nearly three decade career at the agency until recently the likelihood of massive refunds seemed nil although california lawmakers led by davis had demanded relief for costs that ran as high as times or more than the rates a year ago ferc officials had not agreed and their minds seemed set when ferc first proposed remedies for the california price increases late last year commissioners said refunds may be an inferior remedy from a market perspective and not the fundamental solution to any problems occurring in california markets to date ferc has ordered million in refunds for alleged overcharges in january and february but with the recent appointment of two new commissioners by president bush republicans patrick h wood iii of texas and nora m brownell of pennsylvania ferc s position softened leading to the price mitigation ordered last week now ferc is taking a closer look at the prices already charged california lawmakers have pegged overcharges at nearly billion since the california market went haywire last summer a number that comes from a study done by cal iso the operator of california s electricity grid cal iso officials acknowledged last week that the study might have significant flaws among companies that may be required to reduce their bills are energy giants enron corp mirant corp duke energy corp williams cos and reliant energy inc all of which are expected to have representatives at the negotiations the companies have hotly disputed the amount of overcharges alleged by davis and other california lawmakers and point out that they have yet to be paid for the vast majority of electricity sold in the state in recent months today wagner said he plans to make opening statements to the media after that he said he hasn t determined how much of the wangling will be done behind closed doors if the parties don t come to an agreement in days wagner will have seven days to make a recommendation on refunds to ferc s five commissioners it is a process that may be repeated down the road if sen barbara boxer d calif and other california politicians get their way boxer has introduced legislation that would give ferc retroactive power to order refunds all the way back to july when san diego first faced huge spikes in electricity costs business bechtel holds its own despite economic downturn s f construction giant s revenues remain steady todd wallack the san francisco chronicle final page b copyright the economy is skidding tech firms are shutting plants and reining in expansion plans and two major engineering and construction firms stone webster and washington group formerly morrison knudsen sought bankruptcy protection during the past months so it would come as no surprise to hear that the world s largest engineering and construction firm san francisco s bechtel group is getting pinched by the downturn only it isn t despite the slowdown in the economy and in some areas of construction bechtel and many rivals are still busy upgrading cellular networks building railroads and airports and completing new power plants our guys are working to hours a week completing deals said john siegel vice president of marketing and strategy for bechtel s power plant construction division you walk around at p m and everyone is still here overall bechtel s sales dipped percent last year to billion but that s still up percent from and a healthy percent from the company said operating margins improved last year and employment jumped by a quarter during the past five years to worldwide including in san francisco both employment and sales are holding firm so far this year the privately held firm doesn t release earnings figures bechtel isn t alone shares in fluor the second largest engineering and construction firm and jacobs engineering group nearly doubled in value during the past months and some analysts are bullish on the future we could be on the front end of a multiyear up cycle merrill lynch analyst fritz von carp predicts contrary cycles although the engineering and construction industry has long been vulnerable to sharp downturns von carp said the cycles often differ from the rest of the u s economy for instance high energy prices usually spell bad news for most domestic businesses but an energy shortage could help spur a boom in new power plants refineries and pipelines lifting the petroleum sector out of a decade old funk that has long been a major business for firms such as bechtel in addition von carp points out that government agencies typically garner a large share of transportation revenue from gasoline taxes which aren t as sensitive to downturns as income taxes and capital gains california and other states have also increasingly walled off those funds so politicians can t raid the transportation war chests to pay other bills when budgets are tight government agencies and big businesses also tend to initiate major projects when times are good but because the projects often take years to start and complete they often wind up ramping up after the economy has already slid into recession it is really a late cycle von carp said this isn t to say that bechtel s business is humming across the board bechtel executive vice president jude laspa said sales remain lackluster in its mining and chemical division and despite von carp s predictions of an upswing in the petroleum industry laspa said sales haven t picked up so far we have some very robust businesses and some that are in a cyclical downturn laspa said tight margins engineering and construction companies also have to be content with lower profit margins than those in many other industries like its rivals bechtel typically pockets about to percent of revenues after taxes laspa said operating margins are closer to to percent by contrast anything under percent is considered anemic in the newspaper industry this is a low margin business von carp said industry players are also increasingly taking on more risk bidding on fixed price contracts to compete in the past many firms charged by the hour and profits soared when projects became mired in delays now that companies are getting only a lump sum for a development major setbacks in a project or two could sink a firm stone webster of boston for instance filed for chapter bankruptcy protection last year largely because of delays in building a gas fired power plant in tiverton r i shaw group later acquired most of the firm s assets meanwhile washington group of boise idaho foundered after it acquired raytheon s engineers and constructors unit igniting a nasty court battle washington accused raytheon of concealing problems with several of the projects and demanded compensation raytheon blamed washington for mismanaging the projects and insisted it owed nothing although bechtel doesn t let outsiders review its books analysts say they believe the firm has largely avoided such problems and is financially solid bechtel executives point out that the company is percent larger than its next biggest competitor bechtel is considered in the industry to be the pre eminent engineering and construction company von carp said it is a very good competitor with a strong franchise in many markets on top in telecom bechtel has also enjoyed some luck lately for instance some telecommunications equipment firms are doing so poorly that one analyst compared it to a nuclear winter dozens of data service providers such as northpoint communications in emeryville have shut down others have severely reined in their expansion plans but bechtel s revenues are up to percent this year george conniff president of bechtel s telecommunications and industrial business unit said his firm mainly serves financially solid firms such as at t wireless which are still going ahead with plans to add new towers despite the slowdown he also said the unit has picked up some consulting business abandoned by equipment firms trying to narrow their focus to weather the downturn we re having a great year conniff said when the river is muddy the fish start to bite but no part of the business is doing as well as bechtel power a powerhouse in energy the power business is doing spectacular von carp said it is the strongest part of the market now bar none siegel said the company has plants under construction worldwide up from about nine four years ago and many more in the pipeline particularly in the united states siegel said the unit s revenue rose to percent last year and is on pace to match that this year he said the firm could probably land even more business if it had the ability to pursue and handle more projects through another unit bechtel is also investing in power plants under development in hayward pittsburg and san jose the company struck a deal with san jose s calpine in to spend billion building several plants in the bay area under the deal the companies will jointly own the plants and split the profits down the middle because of the strong demand for electricity in california bechtel spokesman jeff leichtman said it will probably wind up spending at least million more than originally announced bechtel doesn t own any existing plants in the united states so it isn t among those accused of gouging consumers in the recent energy crisis but that s partly an accident of fate the firm s investment arm teamed with pg e in the late s to start building plants but in pg e offered to buy out bechtel for most of the u s operations bechtel sold the rest of its u s stakes shortly thereafter but bechtel kept the shares in its overseas plants and bought out pg e a year later bechtel now operates the foreign plants through a division called intergen it also owns more than half of nexant an energy consulting firm based in san francisco now at a time when many bay area firms are being hurt by the energy crisis bechtel stands to cash in and laspa said word is already leaking out he said the firm is getting inundated by

over power state delegation seeking refunds lynda gledhill christian berthelsen the san francisco chronicle final page a copyright a critical showdown in california s energy crisis starts this morning as state officials meet with energy companies to demand billion in refunds a day settlement conference ordered as part of the federal energy regulatory commission s decision last week to put price controls on wholesale electricity prices will bring together the parties that have been squabbling for the past year we are going to washington with one goal and that is to bring back billion gov gray davis told reporters yesterday the fact is that people have taken advantage of the market gamed the system and ripped people off but davis crusade may be dampened by challenges to the study the state used to arrive at the billion figure and by a ferc mediator s prediction that california will walk away with less than it is demanding the democratic governor s figure is based on an update of a march study by the california independent system operator which manages the sate s power grid some energy experts argue the study is flawed but the iso stood firm behind its methodology yesterday curtis l wagner jr the ferc administrative law judge who will oversee the meeting said in an interview with the chronicle yesterday that he was optimistic a settlement would be reached wagner said the billion seems a little high and the generators numbers seem low we ll probably come out somewhere in between the veteran mediator who spent yesterday reviewing spreadsheets submitted by the parties said he will look at applying last week s commission price control order back to october i think we should put the refund issue to rest wagner said i m sure we can agree on a structure that is fair to everybody enron corp reliant energy inc duke energy corp williams cos dynegy inc and mirant corp are among the companies facing allegations of illegally overcharging california the companies say the high prices were a result of the high costs of natural gas used to generate power there has been no evidence to suggest that suppliers bilked anyone said mark stultz a vice president of the electric power supply association which represent the generators but davis insisted that the state will recover the full amount it is asking under the law ferc has no discretion he said it is mandated to refund excessive charges if prices were found to be unjust and unreasonable which they were the governor however acknowledged that some of the money he is demanding may be owed by municipal utilities that do not fall under ferc s jurisdiction davis adviser nancy mcfadden said municipal utilities such as los angeles department of water and power and bc hydro that sold electricity to the state have been invited to join the talks as well we need the ferc to lay the basis to seek refunds from private generators and use that as a basis to seek refunds from public generators she said california could face an obstacle in its case for the full repayment it seeks under ferc rules overcharges can only be authorized after a formal investigation is ordered which in this case started on oct if wagner sticks to that time frame it eliminates the summer months when prices first began to spike there is no question we can order refund from that october date forward wagner said legally there may be some question before that date but wagner said a ferc regulations may not necessarily rule out broader refunds that s the great thing about a settlement you can do anything he said if no settlement is reached in days wagner will forward his recommendations to the full commission for its approval california will then have the option of pursuing the matter further in court california s delegation will be led by michael kahn a san francisco lawyer who chairs the iso davis also meets today in sacramento with new ferc commissioners patrick wood and nora brownell to discuss the refunds and the high cost of natural gas in the state wood who is expected to be named chairman of the commission in the fall has expressed his support for finding solutions to california s power woes energy crunch direct access falls victim to crisis power buying plan s future is in doubt bernadette tansey greg lucas chronicle staff writers sunday june san francisco chronicle url nl dtl the option to shop around for the best deal on electricity one of the cornerstones of california s deregulation plan could soon be scrapped businesses may lose the right to cut their own deals with private power suppliers and environmentally conscious consumers could be barred from shifting their business from utilities to renewable energy firms unless the legislature acts quickly to save the program the potential cost savings of so called direct access to competing electricity providers was the plum that incited big businesses to fight hard for deregulation in but the program although it was not responsible for the soaring rates that piled up state and utility debt may be sacrificed in the state s drive to recoup its costs the fate of the program was thrown into doubt last winter when skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs collapsed the nascent direct access market weakened the utilities and caused the state to take over power purchases industry has been lobbying hard since then to keep the option open for the future but the problem for gov gray davis administration is that the state needs big industrial consumers to stay on as utility customers to help pay off the billion it has already spent buying power and the estimated billion worth of power it has contracted to buy over the next years otherwise the utility customers left behind householders and small businesses will be stuck with the whole bill competing proposals to allow companies to bail out by paying an exit fee to cover a share of the cost are working their way through the legislature but time is running short state treasurer philip angelides warned the legislature and the state public utilities commission this month the state plans to issue billion in bonds in september for power purchases and officials say underwriters want to to be assured that there is a large enough revenue stream to repay the bonds angelides and other state officials urged the legislature and the puc to decide by the end of june either to ban direct access or lock in a procedure to charge each departing company for its share of the state power costs the hypothetical and theoretical desires for a direct access market and the hypothetical and theoretical desire for a bond sale are now intersecting in reality said assemblyman fred keeley d boulder creek santa cruz county industry advocates agree that firms should pay a fair share of the electricity purchased on their behalf but how much and how to make that calculation is a complex issue they fear will be decided in haste said dorothy rothrock a lobbyist for the california manufacturers and technology association we are reacting to crises real or man made and making decisions in a rush without considering the consequences rothrock said the puc is set to vote thursday on a proposed urgency measure to suspend direct access as of july the ban recommended by a puc administrative law judge would continue as long as the state functions as power buyer for utility customers conceivably through the term of state contracts ending in lawmakers had authorized the puc to suspend direct access last winter when the state took over electricity purchasing but a divided puc delayed action as legislators worked with industry to salvage the program although direct access contracts are still legal until the puc acts in effect the program was slammed into suspension by the brutal power price hikes of the past months threatened by exposure to rising wholesale electricity rates virtually all direct access customers have returned to the utilities where they are protected by the state rate freeze even though the right to deal directly with generators has been on the books since few businesses or householders actually did it many of the residential customers who signed on with alternative suppliers did so to support the growth of renewable power like solar and wind energy at its peak the program drew about households about percent of the customer base of california s major utilities about percent of the industrial market contracted for their own power industry has until tomorrow to file plans with the puc to preserve direct access under a proposal by public utilities commissioner richard bilas a strong supporter of the program commissioner jeff brown said he favors direct access but the continuing uncertainty over the form it would take jeopardizes the state s ability to float its bonds commissioner carl wood a direct access opponent said it should be abolished because it creates a danger that residential and small business customers will be stuck paying for relatively high cost contracts secured by the state during the energy crisis while large industries would be free to buy cheap power from the newer more efficient plants that will be coming online in the next few years but wood said even if the puc suspends the option the state legislature could order its reinstatement sen debra bowen d marina del rey is carrying a bill to do that while requiring the exit fees demanded by angelides and state finance officials without those safeguards utility revenues would dive into a death spiral where rates would keep rising as more companies abandoned the system bowen said giving the remaining customers a deeper incentive to bail state legislators are set to meet this week to start deciding how california s electricity market should be structured in the future but deadlines to deal with the state s financial hangover are pushing decisions on direct access bowen said it s unlikely her bill will be passed within a few weeks the time frame davis administration officials have urged to give certainty to the terms of the bond deal angelides said the legislature could still pass a law reviving direct access before the bond language is written in july but after that the legislature cannot pass laws that change the terms of contract commitments made by the state he said there is still a window to act here but they have to act fast angelides said e mail bernadette tansey at btansey sfchronicle com and greg lucas at glucas sfchronicle com san francisco chronicle page a energy

dismantling california s energy markets former gov pete wilson says he s proud of his role in deregulation and is stunned and outraged that his successor tries to pin the blame on him former state senate president pro tem bill lockyer now the state attorney general is both contrite and vengeful recently saying he wanted to put a powerful energy executive and friend of president bush in prison with an amorous cellmate named spike former assembly speaker curt pringle presently a lobbyist now forwards e mail jokes to fellow republicans with davis re election slogans including davis in your bridge to the th century these were the leaders who brought deregulation to california as they engage in deflections and defenses one year after the state plunged into crisis their comments also highlight a newer debate over unintended consequences the role of the federal government in making things worse and the neglectfulness of subsequent politicians for his part wilson has become increasingly angry at the davis administration s offensive and unfair claims that wilson and the legislature got the state into this mess i m afraid they have reached the conclusion that the response has been too little too late to avoid what will be hundreds of hours of blackouts and that they better find a way to blame somebody else wilson said davis he said has blamed the new administration in washington the old administration in sacramento power providers it s interesting because there was not a peep out of the lieutenant governor davis at the time during what i thought was a fairly active and public debate he was hardly without a voice but he certainly was without comment wilson said davis performance over the past year called into question davis campaign slogan i used to laugh when he talked about being the best trained best prepared candidate in history wilson said but what the hell deregulation bill a tiny legislative committee that was dominated by state sen steve peace d el cajon and then assemblyman james brulte r rancho cucamonga wrote the deregulation bill in corporate lobbyists and utilities also had tremendous sway over the legislation pringle lockyer and wilson steered the legislation their way the bill was a reaction to movements under way at the california public utilities commission and in the federal government the bill essentially unbundled the big utilities monopoly over power separating control of selling marketing and producing energy it also was supposed to cut rates percent and pay utilities hundreds of millions of dollars for investments they d made in nuclear power and other energy plants wilson said davis should in fact be grateful that the deregulation bill encouraged power companies to expand into california he contends that without the measure the state would be faced with a regulated market and fewer megawatts of power and more blackouts davis complaints davis has continually said that california failed to build power plants in the years before his administration in truth seven smaller power plants were built during wilson s eight years and deregulation started the process on a host of others that are now being approved more quickly by the davis administration we wanted to entice investors wilson said you can t do that if they re not allowed to compete wilson acknowledges that the state misread exactly how quickly california would grow during the high tech boom silicon valley built acres of server farms to supply the internet that accounted for a large amount of the increase in new power usage in california peace has point blank blamed executives at cisco systems he has said they should be thrown in jail for simultaneously supplying the server farm boom and opposing the building of a power plant in santa clara county cisco opposed the megawatt plant it said to protect the health and welfare of its employees nearby wilson doesn t go as far as peace in wanting to jail people and he s not willing to accuse out of state generators of price gouging in part because blanket condemnation may scare away further investment in california and it ignores that some municipal utilities in california charge high prices as well if they find that people have in fact manipulated the market wilson said then they ought to come down hard on them lockyer s harder line as attorney general lockyer has opened an investigation into whether power companies have conspired to push up electricity prices and gouge consumers unlike peace and wilson lockyer is unwilling to defend the legislation and deregulation if i could repeal it and start all over again i think that i would he said but even lockyer acknowledges that the legislature needed to do something in that s because it appeared inevitable that the utilities and corporate interests would get some form of deregulation through the state puc and the federal government which had already opened up the natural gas market our energy experts thought the puc was doing it in a way that was overly friendly to big business and would have ended up having residential customers subsidizing big business lockyer said the efforts were made to try to figure out how to make the market competitive without tilting toward big business the real killer in deregulation lockyer contends is that neither the legislature himself included nor the governor paid enough attention to the supply end that allowed a handful of firms to have near total control over power output lockyer said peace has called this the domestic equivalent of opec in the west lockyer has been busy demonizing power firms as well he still faces criticism for telling the wall street journal his plans for kenneth lay chairman of the texas energy trader enron corp i d love to personally escort lay to an by cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says hi my name is spike honey lockyer who told the chronicle he was directing his comments to the east coast financial establishment toned down a bit in a more recent interview the system works well it doesn t work when there is illegal activity and a handful of companies that control the whole market lockyer said and then there is pringle who generally has escaped questioning for his role in getting the measure passed pringle said he had little impact on the legislation relying instead on brulte but he puts some blame on consumer groups that offered proposition in which set out to roll back much of the deregulation measure wilson has charts from the state energy commission showing the application to build plants spiked up after the measure was defeated at the most critical moment pringle said when we were trying to suck development into the state you had trepidation wilson lockyer and pringle have been relatively silent on the matter when compared with peace peace has been waging his own relentless war both defending the legislation and accusing the federal government of creating a flawed national model of electricity deregulation and then failing to confront the consequences the real culprit is far more complicated than just proposition peace contended in a recent letter to bush the state puc he said ordered utilities in the early s to build more plants but the utilities got federal regulators to overrule the order among other things he said the federal government uncritically adopted a flawed plan separating the west s transmission system from the generation of electricity that allows generators to extort the grid operator by threatening to withhold power he added pringle said he can t even attempt to get as detailed as peace when it comes to explaining what went wrong everyone has a degree in which they need to stand up but the people in charge today are in charge of fixing it pringle said if you want to go around the rosy and say did republicans blow something yeah did wilson yeah lockyer brulte peace yeah the consumer associations we re all tagged e mail robert salladay at rsalladay sfchronicle com san francisco chronicle page a pending power plants in california face some problems posted at p m pdt sunday june by steve johnson mercury news although california s summer energy outlook seems to be brightening state leaders still are counting on new power plants to boost competition and lower electricity prices in years to come they may end up disappointed even with new power plants in the works before the california energy commission as of early last week the state can t be sure of how much power they will produce or what prices they will charge experts say that could prove troublesome since percent of the power the state plans to buy through long term contracts is supposed to come from these new plants nor is there any guarantee of the price these plants might charge for the rest of their power on the spot market despite last monday s order by federal regulators to generally limit spot prices across the west like much of what has happened since the state passed deregulation the future appears cloudy here s why critics say the price caps ordered monday by the federal energy regulatory commission contain loopholes that could allow california s electricity costs to soar on days when it is desperate for power and when the mercury news asked of the companies involved in the recently approved or pending power plants if they could promise that their spot market prices would be cheaper than what california has been paying recently none could of the mostly private entities involved in these new power plant projects only six are generators new to the state and most of their plants are relatively small that may slow the development of a more competitive electricity market which state officials say is needed to lower prices more than a third of the electricity to be produced by these new operations would be controlled by firms accused in recent lawsuits or governmental actions of questionable pricing and in some cases outright gouging state officials claim that some of these companies among other things have shut down their plants when electricity demand was high to artificially crimp supplies and inflate prices some experts doubt that all of the proposed plants will get built several power companies acknowledged that the intense criticism of them by california officials and uncertainties over the economic viability of owning plants here could cause them to delay or even abandon their projects others suspect these firms eventually may cancel some of the plants they have proposed to keep power in short supply and prices high i m concerned said california public utilities commissioner carl wood when asked about the makeup of the firms proposing the new plants it s the same cartel we will have more generation but we will have the same players owning and controlling it such comments irk power suppliers who have repeatedly denied breaking any laws or regulations governing the sale of wholesale electricity many of these entrepreneurs find it particularly galling that the very state officials accusing them of price gouging are begging them to build plants in california few politicians have been as vehement in their denunciation of electricity suppliers as gov gray davis yet he is among those relying heavily on the new power plants these companies are developing to help pull california out of its energy crisis eventually when supply and demand come back into something approaching balance there will be genuine price competition davis said in december he repeated the point earlier this month proclaiming that by the fall of we will have more power than we need that will solve the long term problem davis isn t alone although power costs have fallen in recent weeks and federal officials may impose tougher price controls on electricity the assumption that more plants is the key to solving california s troubles is taken as gospel by many state and federal officials it seems logical enough more power presumably would not only ease the threat of blackouts but relieve california of the need to pay exorbitant prices on days when electricity is in short supply but calculating how much more power the state will wind up with based on how many plants are on the drawing board is risky say some state regulators and consumer advocates i have no confidence at the moment that a majority of those new plants will ever materialize because power companies are likely to maintain an electricity shortage to keep prices high said michael shames of the utility consumers action network why would they want to change what they ve got they ve got a sweet deal another reason plants might not get built is politics several firms with projects in the works claimed that threats by state officials to seize their plants or impose a windfall profits tax on their sales had made it harder to obtain financing every time these politicians start spouting off to improve their own political careers they don t realize the damage they re doing said gary ackerman of the western power trading forum just this month mirant corp of atlanta received state permission to build a megawatt plant in contra costa county enough to supply power to about homes and it has applied to build a similarly sized generator in san francisco but its spokesman chuck griffin said both projects are on hold until mirant feels more comfortable about the state s political and economic climate we have to be able to determine that it s going to be a viable investment he said even if all plants are built many of the companies proposing them were skittish about promising cheaper prices they said it depends on such things as the future cost of natural gas which many of their plants use for fuel one firm california is counting on is calpine corp of san jose which already commands a modest fleet of small plants in the state and is developing nearly one fourth of the new plants although calpine has earned huge profits in recent months it has a relatively good reputation among consumer advocates and state investigators who have reviewed its confidential power sales data moreover calpine s name is conspicuously absent from recent lawsuits and federal legal filings that have either accused other firms of gouging or questioned the reasonableness of their prices much of the power to be generated from calpine s new plants will be sold in long term contracts to the state according to company spokesman bill highlander but like other suppliers he was vague about what it would charge for the rest it kind of depends on a whole number of factors highlander said including how much people conserve and how much power california can continue importing from other states since no one can predict such things today he added that s what makes it so difficult if anyone should be concerned about the price of power it s the folks at pg e corp who have blamed high electricity costs for forcing their utility pacific gas electric co into bankruptcy but even they wouldn t speculate about how much they would charge for the power from their megawatt plant in kern county which is to be built by their unregulated affiliate pg e national energy group pg e s energy trading arm is among the suppliers accused of questionable pricing practices although pg e officials have denied any wrongdoing by the time the kern county plant is done in two years if we have a situation where we are seeing a lot more generation come on line in the state economic law should dictate that prices will come down said pg e corp spokesman greg pruett but that s not for certain he said adding we ve all gone to school about how topsy turvy the market could become like every other generator pg e doesn t plan to spend a lot of money building a plant just to wind up giving away its electricity obviously pruett said everyone who invests in these is doing so to earn a profit contact steve johnson at sjohnson sjmercury com or county should unplug this energy saving idea published monday june in the san jose mercury news turn off those computers turn up those thermostats replace those old watt sucking appliances it s not just for people and business it s government s obligation too but please there s no need to let energy conservation get in the way of providing essential public services to the community the santa clara county board of supervisors set an admirable goal of cutting energy consumption in county buildings by percent thermostats are edging up toward degrees lights are on motion detectors and timers non essential elevators are out of service so far so good on tuesday the board will consider another idea closing the east wing of the government center at w hedding st and offices on berger drive in san jose a few days a month several county departments including the tax collector assessor and clerk recorder would have extended hours four days a week but would close on monday or friday closing buildings would definitely save the county money on energy bills but it s not worth it most county residents visit the government center only a few times in their lives to pay a delinquent tax bill record a deed get a birth certificate it would be impossible to get the word out to everyone in time that the offices will be closed invariably people will take time off from work to trek to the county building for some urgent matter and find the place locked up tight several departments report that they would face serious delays in processing documents if they had to shut down which would cost people and businesses time and money why not close just some departments at w hedding there s no way to shut down the lights and air conditioning on one floor without shutting down the whole system san mateo county and the city of palo alto have had luck with similar alternative work week schemes but san mateo moved essential offices into another building rather than close them down and palo alto ran an extensive education campaign to prepare people for the switch the county doesn t have time for that if the plan is to go into effect next month supervisor liz kniss gets credit for exploring all options but she and the board should drop this one the state of california managed to cut energy use in its office buildings by more than percent by just taking the usual prudent steps without eliminating any services the county can do so too besides where will the affected county employees be on those days when they aren t at the office at home most likely running their air conditioners computers and tvs the ferc loophole published monday june in the san jose mercury news by peter navarro the federal energy regulatory commission s new wholesale price limits will save the western states literally tens of billions of dollars in electricity bills as wonderful as that sounds the ferc order still allows wholesale generators to extract enough windfall profits to drive the region into recession ferc s approach may also perversely lead to more air pollution and natural gas shortages in california market manipulation has taken place on a grand theft scale in california s electricity bill was about billion last year it was almost billion for roughly the same amount of electricity this year california s bill is well on its way to billion annually to stop this ripoff gov gray davis proposed cost based price caps such caps are calculated on a plant specific basis each generator is allowed to recover its cost of production including a fair profit thus for example a newer highly efficient plant generating power at a nickel per kilowatt hour would collect a nickel plus profit the oldest least efficient plant that generated power for cents would be allowed to collect cents plus profit that proposal was categorically rejected by ferc instead the commission set a single price for all generators based on the cost of the least efficient plant the obvious problem with this umbrella pricing rule is that it still allows generators to extract billions in windfall profits from consumers under ferc s rule the least efficient plant will collect cents a unit to recover costs plus its profit however the most efficient plant producing power at a nickel per kilowatt also collects cents per unit rather than a nickel and thus extracts a windfall of cents plus profit thus under ferc s rule wholesale generators will still be able to capture billions of dollars extra from consumers and businesses than under davis cost based proposal ferc s approach is still subject to the same kind of strategic gaming that has been the hallmark of this crisis generators will ensure that during peak times when the price cap is being established the most expensive possible plant is in operation whether it needs to be or not this will peg the price at the highest level in addition ferc provides generators with a perverse incentive to run their least efficient units more often since these least efficient plants are also the highest polluting the result will be dirtier air moreover the excessive running of these plants may also put a strain on already stretched natural gas supplies these least efficient plants use up to percent more natural gas to produce a unit of electricity the bottom line ferc s price limits will help california but there still is a danger that higher electricity costs could push california and the rest of the west and eventually the nation into a nasty recession peter navarro is an associate professor of economics and public policy at the university of california irvine he wrote this column for the los angeles times energy talks could get hot ferc settlement conference on california s demand for a billion refund begins today june by dena bunis the orange county register washington it s not quite as hot as a lakers playoff ticket but for energy geeks a seat in hearing room one at the federal energy regulatory commission this morning comes pretty close hundreds of suits with briefcases will file in at a m sharp and put billions of dollars not to mention the future of california s energy market on the table we re going back to washington with one goal and that s to bring back billion gov gray davis told reporters sunday in a conference call from san diego davis stuck to that figure despite comments last week from the ferc s chief judge to the register that he anticipates only a couple of billion dollars in refunds at issue is whether and how much power companies owe the state for wholesale electricity rates that exceeded the reasonable and customary standard federal law establishes the more money the state gets back the less taxpayer money goes toward paying the bill for state purchased power the ferc ordered this conference as part of its price cap decision last week it has given the parties until july to come to an agreement if one isn t reached chief administrative law judge curtis l wagner says he can either ask for more time ask the ferc itself to rule on the refunds or suggest to the ferc that it schedule a formal hearing on the matter something resembling a trial first thing i want to do is find out how much is owed how much has been paid what capacity the sellers still have and what capacity is needed wagner said last week as he prepared for the marathon sessions once that s done he said the refunds will be addressed or maybe the trading of some amounts of money for longer term contracts it s all up in the air michael kahn chairman of california s independent system operator will lead the state delegation to the settlement talks the delegation includes representatives from myriad state agencies including the attorney general who has launched a criminal investigation of private generator charges the iso has estimated that of the billion in alleged overcharges about billion was from private generators the rest was charged by municipal sellers and others who are not under the ferc s jurisdiction we need the ferc to lay the basis for seeking refunds from private generators and we will use that as a basis for dealing with the generators who are not under ferc jurisdiction said nancy mcfadden a davis adviser mcfadden also said the state won t agree to drop civil or criminal proceedings against the generators as part of a refund settlement the generators and utilities which have denied overcharging californians for power were largely mum friday saying they didn t want to jinx the talks but one power generator spokane based avista corp did speak out about the possibility of refunds we are opposed to retroactive refunds said avista spokesman hugh imhof we believe it s fundamentally unfair to change the rules after the fact and mike zenker an analyst at cambridge energy associates a prominent energy consulting firm said the settlement conference will likely include discussions of how state officials meddled in the fledgling market which could affect california s ability to get refunds you can bet that generators are going to argue that the response of elected officials exacerbated the crisis zenker said on friday the ferc commissioners expanded the scope of the talks saying the parties are free to include possible overcharges for power bought in the pacific northwest a number of senators and members of congress had complained to the ferc at hearings here last week that washington state and oregon should not be left out of these negotiations wagner has decided to let the media in to take pictures and listen to the opening statements of the parties but when the real work starts the doors will close and wagner has admonished all the parties not to talk about what happens in the hearing room to outsiders not only will ratepayers in california be watching but so will the players in the home offices of generators nationwide wall street also has a keen interest i think uncertainty is always hard on financial markets said paul fremont an analyst at jeffries co who follows southern california edison and pg e as far as freemont is concerned the utilities have nowhere to go but up i don t think anybody is offering to provide refund money to the utilities he said but utilities do point to the iso financial analysis that chronicles the alleged overcharges by the generators that analysis goes back to may the utilities were still buying power until jan of this year iso says billion in generator overcharges occurred while the utilities were still buying power we are eligible for some of the refunds said gloria quinn washington d c spokeswoman for southern california edison the refunds she said would be used to pay off debt and if any money was left over it would go to the customers kahn the iso chairman was cautious but optimistic that progress if not a settlement would be achieved in the coming two weeks and for its part the government of california s cards are face up generators and marketers kahn said don t go into it thinking i don t know what california s position is they know what it is the question is will that

years used state and federal environmental rules to slow down the process of building new power generators thus adding to the current electricity crisis what they don t often know is that organized labor has used the same environmental rules to stop plant construction also this at first sounds counterintuitive labor unions want to see such projects built given that plant construction provides lucrative work for trades workers but california unions have wanted more than a chance for union contractors to bid on and win such projects when the unions do get plas such as the agreement granted by the orange county board of supervisors to local unions for most public works projects countywide their involvement can drive up costs percent to percent they want a complete monopoly on major public construction projects unless they are granted project labor agreements plas which ace out open shop contractors and nonunion workers they are willing to use environmental laws to stop the projects completely some critics call it economic blackmail when the unions do get plas such as the agreement granted by the orange county board of supervisors to local unions for most public works projects countywide their involvement can drive up costs percent to percent that means fewer plants built for the same money it s the undertold story of the electricity crisis in a consortium of plumbers electricians boilermakers and others formed california unions for reliable energy to target the approval process of powerplants wrote san francisco labor attorney mark r thierman in a january column in engineering news record cure has filed environmental objections against projects by sempra energy occidental petroleum and pg e national energy group as the article explains the unions give up their environmental claims against the project once the builders agree to give nonunion workers the boot since the exclusion of nonunion constructors powerplants have become more expensive to build and less likely to be built this isn t just one man s opinion other sources have uncovered the same blackmail techniques the bakersfield californian reported in december that labor unions have intervened in every new electrical power plant proposed in energy starved california they have threatened lawsuits over the san joaquin wooly thread an endangered plant that is a small inconspicuous member of the sunflower family complained about diesel fumes and cancer in fact a may newsletter from the international brotherhood of electrical workers was upfront about the strategy it said cure feared that a new wave of independent energy generators i e private electricity producers in the wake of deregulation would build and operate plants without union labor cure dedicated itself to a statewide mission to prevent this outcome judging by the predicted blackouts and rising california electrical rates we d suggest the unions succeeded mightily of course every californian will have to pay for this cynical strategy ladwp goes solar welcomes start of summer with conservation kick off to help l a residents beat the heat june los angeles business wire june via newsedge corporation

plant output was controlled by california iso june sacramento calif june prnewswire via newsedge corporation duke energy nyse duk today said the output of its south bay power plant in california was directed by the california independent system operator iso to track fluctuations in electricity demand and the plant operated at top reliability the company strongly denied allegations by three former plant employees that power output was reduced at duke energy s own direction the workers making the allegations were employees of san diego gas electric sdg e who were not hired as part of the new operating team when duke energy assumed full control of the south bay power plant in april bill hall vice president of duke energy s western operations said these allegations represent just one more page in a very long chapter of misinformation disseminated by people who don t know the full story hall reviewed the charges and the facts charge output from south bay was ramped up and down to manipulate prices during times when energy supplies were short the facts the units were operated under the direction of the california iso to meet system reliability and duke energy s contractual commitments while the three ex workers allude to log books from the plant control room with notations from duke energy trading marketing detm the former sdg e south bay employees apparently did not know that that the iso directs output through the detm coordinator our records of iso directions match up perfectly with the logbook notations charge the most expensive unit was run at south bay to drive up iso prices the facts south bay s megawatt jet fueled unit was designed principally to provide start up power to the station s steam units this unit has been made available to provide as much energy as possible to california during the state s energy crisis during the period in question the jet fueled unit was being operated because the price of jet fuel was substantially less than the cost of natural gas this resulted in lower marginal costs the megawatt unit was being run to provide electricity to cover duke energy s california contractual commitments this electricity was not being bid into the iso market so there was no way it could have influenced iso market prices charge inventory management including throwing out spare parts at south bay resulted in increased outage time to accomplish repairs the facts at no time did lack of inventory result in a unit being unavailable for service the inventory management practices at south bay represent standard industry practices duke energy purchased the entire inventory for south bay when we assumed operations for the plant in we retained the parts and tools we deemed useful and disposed of inventory that was damaged or obsolete duke energy employees have taken extraordinary actions to keep our power plants operating during california s energy crisis duke energy continues to deliver real solutions to the

marketers providing electricity in california may have to refund several billion dollars to customers to compensate for overcharging a federal energy regulatory commission ferc administrative law judge said friday the potential refunds however will be no where near the billion claimed by california gov gray davis judge curtis wagner said wagner is to oversee hearings on the alleged overcharges that begin monday in washington d c industry sources have expected such action from federal regulators who already have acknowledged that the power suppliers had overcharged by several hundred million dollars one issue that may complicate the matter is the amount of money that the same power providers are owed by california utilities for electricity they supplied but for which they have not been paid the california governor last week said that power generators and marketers including duke energy dynegy enron reliant energy mirant and williams cos may be due billion just by pacific gas and electric which is in bankruptcy this does not include funds owed by southern california edison or san diego gas electric wagner s comments were not released until after the close of the new york stock exchange on friday the shares of the natural gas and electricity trading companies have been battered in recent weeks in part because of fears they would be required to make refunds c copyright the oil daily co for more infomation call in u s or outside u s californians get rude to enron executives the oil daily c energy intelligence group all rights reserved californians are being downright rude to enron executives these days first california attorney general bill lockyer suggested that enron chairman kenneth lay ought to be forced to spend some time in a prison cell with a tattooed character named spike who was looking for companionship thursday an angry electricity consumer threw a cream pie in the face of president and chief executive jeffrey skilling as he was preparing to address a civic and business group in san francisco according to wire service reports the pie thrower was a woman from the biotic baking brigade an organization that makes a practice of creaming controversial figures past recipients include microsoft chairman bill gates and san francisco mayor willie brown skilling went ahead with his speech to the commonwealth club of california telling them that gov gray davis was not responsible for the current crisis because he had inherited the regulatory morass from the prior administration davis was elected in succeeding republican pete wilson skilling an ardent republican couldn t let the democratic governor escape without some criticism he said that davis had exacerbated the problem by not addressing it promptly when the first signs appeared last year enron vice president karen denne said that company executives anticipated some sort of demonstration by disgruntled electricity consumers obviously this is a very emotional issue she said there was risk in our coming to the state but we feel strongly enough about the issue that we felt it was important to talk about the situation and what could be done to fix the problem denne maintains that listeners received skilling s remarks favorably they did seem to be receptive to the message she said wall street also has been rather impolite to enron of late the company s common stock continues to take hits last week falling to a week low of this is less than half the year s high of reached in august friday it was trading at around that same level the most recent decline came after the federal energy regulatory commission issued an order imposing price mitigation rules on electricity sold to california and other states in the western power grid od jun p the pounding

life after the crisis los angeles times home edition page m copyright the times mirror company for six months californians have been riding an energy crisis that is like some movie monster a weird hard to comprehend creature that morphs and fragments day by day now finally the state is gaining a measure of control the threat of near constant rolling blackouts through the summer is fading though not gone and washington has halfheartedly come to the rescue what s still needed is a long term plan a way to turn this monstrous puzzle into a coherent whole as chairwoman debra bowen d marina del rey of the state senate s energy committee said what do we want this beast to look like we ve got to have pieces that fit together what california will have by the end of this year is a ragged mosaic of emergency edicts from gov gray davis lots of hasty legislative action and a multibillion dollar debt from turning the state into the chief power purchaser consumers already are paying higher electricity bills much higher ones for those who don t conserve there is constant action in the federal bankruptcy court and the acronymic stew of state and federal agencies the experience is unique in california history and might be likened to franklin d roosevelt s first days effort to battle the depression need more money state treasurer phil angelides goes to wall street and borrows billion need more power the legislature creates a california power authority to build the state s own plants if necessary the crisis atmosphere eased last week due in part to stronger federal controls over wholesale power rates prices moderated more plants were back on line the weather was hot but no blackouts followed the state finally released details of its billion in long term energy contracts angelides loan will help end the bleeding of the state s general fund for power purchases and ferc promised to vigorously pursue refunds from the giant power companies that grossly overcharged california this past year it s about time soon payment of back debt will have to be apportioned first what percentage should be paid generators should be prepared to accept less than after that taxpayers utility customers and the utilities parent companies may have to shoulder more burden that will be unpleasant then what bowen plans to hold a hearing soon on what should california s electricity marketplace look like topics that need to be covered include the future role of the utilities improving natural gas supplies to the state and restoring suspended environmental controls the state should aggressively increase alternative and renewable energy it also needs to decide whether there is any advantage in taking over the transmission grid and to figure out the best way to get itself out of the power buying business there can be no return to the old regulated system since most of the utilities old power plants are now owned by private generators the disastrous deregulation has already been largely undone we know from the state s hard experience that electric power is too critical to be trusted entirely to the free market what is not clear yet is how much regulatory control is needed and who should supply it there will be no easy answers but if we define the right questions the beastly puzzle will start to make sense,Phishing,Data Breach,0.65449719867335,False

the lighthouse enlightening ideas for public policy vol issue october welcome to the lighthouse the e mail newsletter of the independent institute the non partisan public policy research organization we provide you with updates of the institute s current research publications events and media programs in this week s issue holding bureaucrats personally accountable a st amendment victory the independent review fall issue now available public health vs the nanny state next independent policy forum holding bureaucrats personally accountable a st amendment victory the legal doctrine of sovereign immunity and its modern cousin qualified immunity has historically allowed government bureaucrats to escape full accountability for misdeeds they have perpetrated under the guise of government policy thus a recent decision by the ninth circuit court of appeals ruling that a group of government bureaucrats may be held personally liable for outrageous constitutional violations is news worthy of celebration the facts of the case attest to the need for strong checks on government power three berkeley calif residents had campaigned against a proposed homeless shelter in their neighborhood at the behest of local housing rights activists who said the anti shelter campaign was discriminatory and violated the fair housing act the u s department of housing and urban development hud got into the act hud officials demanded interviews with the three anti shelter neighbors told their neighbors they had violated the law and ordered them to give hud all materials including the names addresses and phone numbers of other opponents of the shelter that they had collected for their campaign to the berkeley three hud s harassment violated their freedom of speech to the appeals court qualified immunity of government bureaucrats did not apply here the berkeley three may proceed with their first amendment lawsuit against the hud officials and seek monetary damages this ruling although unusual by today s standards harks back to another early legal tradition the idea that citizens can hold government officials personally liable for improper conduct in john wilkes a member of britain s parliament was the subject of an outrageous search and seizure warrant issued by secretary of state lord halifax after wilkes published an anonymous attack on the government wilkes then sued halifax and other officials and was awarded a sum comparable to million today americans were so enraptured with this refutation of unrestrained government power that they made wilkes a hero and followed in his footsteps suing government officials for unreasonable search and seizures since the th century however this common law tradition has nearly withered away the creation of the exclusionary rule has replaced wilkes s remedy with an inferior one while the exclusionary rule brings some satisfaction to criminals who are the subject of unreasonable searches and seizures it does nothing for the innocent furthermore the th century has seen the rise of the doctrine of qualified immunity which the u s supreme court explains seeks to ensure that government defendants reasonably can anticipate when their conduct may give rise to liability by attaching liability only if t he contours of the right violated are sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right the ninth circuit s recent ruling that hud officials were not acting reasonably when they violated the first amendment rights of the berkeley three is refreshing because it rekindles the idea that civil liability can be a restraint on government power in an era when bureaucratic violations of the rule of law have become routine it is an idea long overdue for the ninth circuit s opinion see for a press release by supporters of the berkeley three the center for individual rights see hud officials declared personally liable at for more information on

svmg org cc subject fw puc rate proposal disaster please call and fax puc commissioners brown duque and lynch info below svmg member companies we urgently request your support in sending a strong message today and tomorrow to the puc that the proposed rate proposal is unacceptable to svmg employers its workers and families we have only until pm this evening to submit formal comments for the proposed rate structure just this morning a brief analysis is below please call or fax the following public utilities commissioners immediately with our urgent message please and let me know if you and your organization have done so also don t forget to avail yourself of one last opportunity to directly meet with the puc at a public hearing regarding this rate proposal at the doubletree hotel tomorrow friday may at gateway place to participate you must arrive early and sign in to speak a member of the public advisor s office will be there for assistance to get more advice about participation at the hearing contact the puc s public advisory office at thank you for your help at this critical time justin bradley director of energy programs geoffrey brown phone fax perhaps the key swing vote most important focus of advocacy henry m duque phone fax historically on side of business but needs encouragement carl wood phone fax most anti business voting record probably intractable president loretta lynch fax unlikely to change vote from public stance but worth a try based on past relationships and connection to gov davis the puc unveiled their proposal with the following rate allocations residential customers are protected with an average rate increase of small commercial users large energy users up to from to this does not include the cent rate increase proposed in january which would increase the large energy users rate by a fair and proportional rate increase would be an average increase of for all customers president lynch admitted that this may not be enough and that additional rate increases could be required in the future in protecting the residential rate classes the puc is shifting approximately billion from the residential rates to all other customer classes it is important that we all svmg member companies communicate to our puc commissioners the danger of protecting residential rates where the use of power is more discretionary and flexible than for employers unfairly high business rates decrease productive electricity use with subsequent loss of goods and services and jobs protecting the residential rate class is bad policy because it guts the incentive for many residents to conserve svmg understands that prices must rise significantly to accommodate the cost of electricity it is regrettable but any plan must be equitable and proportional between all rate classes with no cross subsidization the svmg press release form this morning is below the puc release is in the link below the puc release p u c is a w o l on proposed rate increase s effect on the economy and efforts for residential conservation for immediate release contact michelle montague bruno may the disproportional rate increases proposed by the puc will devastate the state and potentially the nation s economy said carl guardino president and ceo of the silicon valley manufacturing group in response to electricity rate increases being suggested by the public utilities commission puc and its president loretta lynch the puc president s proposal has three critical flaws it undermines the governor and the legislature s conservation plan which already tilts heavily toward residential customers because the puc proposal provides individuals with no incentives to conserve it is devastating to california s economy which will cripple california companies and every working family that depends on a healthy business climate to maintain jobs coupled with the economic downturn california employers already face this commission is either insensitive or ignorant to the further loss of jobs this proposal could create the puc may think that by shielding residential customers from paying our proportionate share that they are doing everyone a favor yet it s pretty hard to pay your bills when a disproportionate plan forces your employer out of business or out of california said guardino yesterday the puc proposed raising rates for some employers by to percent which would be the second increase handed to the industrial business community this year for many employers the recently proposed rate increases will equate to a percent increase in electric bills in less than five months this is irresponsible behavior at a time when the state s economy is already reeling from an economic downturn that has hurt employers and lost jobs for working families said guardino many companies including roche pharmaceuticals have had very aggressive energy reduction programs in place for several years which will continue to further cut consumption in order to pay for a non proportional and destructive rate increase for some employers could mean cutting into their workforce or leaving the area all together said dr james woody president of roche pharmaceuticals r d in palo alto and chairman of the board of the silicon valley manufacturing group we want to do our fair share in paying for rate increases but the disproportionate nature of this proposal could be devastating to employers we need a rate structure that will allow employers to thrive and help pull us out of this economic downturn the silicon valley manufacturing group understands and acknowledges the need to raise electric rates to help minimize blackouts which will protect the public s health and safety however to achieve desired conservation and fairness it is essential that all californians share proportionally in rate adjustments proportional rate increases should be implemented with no rate shifting between classes of energy users member companies of svmg are committed to being part of the solution as we work together to conserve power retain our workforce and ensure a healthy economy said guardino apparently the puc is out of touch with working families conservation or jobs in california said guardino it s a naive proposal it assumes we can put a firewall between working families and jobs their employers provide but instead this notion threatens the livelihoods of california workers and businesses,Phishing,Data Breach,0.5223893463390222,False

panel wsj tues love war and california electricity energy refund talks open on divisive note by david whitney bee washington bureau published june washington more than lawyers and corporate chiefs crowded into a courtroom monday to begin secret talks aimed at ending months of bitterness and accusations over who should pay for california s haywire energy market but the largely closed door sessions before a federal energy regulatory commission judge could be doomed from the start by sharply divided estimates of how much money it will take to leave the past behind and launch california toward a new energy future the state says its consumers have been overcharged by at least billion but curtis wagner ferc s chief administrative law judge who is presiding over the settlement negotiations said he believes at most it will be billion to billion we told everyone that billion is the floor it is the most conservative possible number michael kahn a power grid official who is heading the state s delegation told reporters after monday s talks the state s firm stance and wagner s day deadline for results had many predicting that little would come of the talks i believe california is going to scuttle the talks i believe that nothing will be good enough for them said arthur o donnell editor of california energy markets an industry newsletter more than billion of the state s claims involve deals that are ineligible for refunds because of the seller or the date sold o donnell said ferc doesn t have jurisdiction over all traders and it already has excluded many months of trades from refunds if the parties fail to settle within days wagner has another week to submit his own recommendations to the five ferc commissioners on how he thinks they should resolve the disputes wagner warned the parties that settlement would be the far preferable course i can tell you now that you are far better off to work out the refund issue in these settlement proceedings the blunt speaking judge said the time to put california s past energy problems to rest and to structure a new arrangement for california s energy future is now wagner held out a carrot to the generators who have been pummeled by gov gray davis and state attorney general bill lockyer over allegations of market manipulation to drive up prices and their profits there are questions concerning whether the settlement should offer immunity from existing and future lawsuits and prosecutions against generators wagner said california argues that power plant owners and traders manipulated a badly flawed market to drive up prices racking up billion in overcharges from may until may but electricity sellers say they obeyed the law and they contend it s unfair to change the rules retroactively assuming the refund issue is resolved wagner said there are at least six other issues on the table they include agreement on moving power out of the volatile spot market and selling it under long term contracts eliminating natural gas transmission constraints blamed for the high cost of gas in california and settlement of financial issues connected with pg e s bankruptcy filing wagner began the brief public opening of the negotiations by reading a statement from ferc s two newest members patrick wood iii and nora mead brownell the forces behind the order convening the talks wood and brownell said in a statement that it is in everyone s best interest to bring closure to the crisis and urged the participants to resist trying to blame each other for the power debacle everyone must leave the negotiations with more than they came in with they said but skepticism remained high monday we didn t take two weeks to get into this said one participant late in the day it s hard to see how we ll get out of this in two weeks among the participants are legal teams representing about government agencies utilities and power generators including pacific gas and electric co southern california edison san diego gas electric and their corporate parents and subsidiaries the talks also include municipal utilities such as the sacramento municipal utility district more than a dozen california towns and irrigation districts and utilities in washington montana idaho colorado new mexico and arizona meanwhile ferc commissioners wood and brownell were in sacramento to confer with davis and legislative leaders then conduct a fact finding hearing with california regulators on the high price of natural gas brownell and wood davis said are committed to working together with us to drive down the price of natural gas in california to get it closer to what the rest of the country is paying i think we are turning a corner he said conservation has been spectacular the outlook looks much more

this report daniel weintraub davis energy contracts preserve long term pain published june with blackouts held at bay federal price controls taking effect and the spot market cost for wholesale electricity declining toward historic lows things are looking good for gov gray davis if current trends continue the governor s public approval ratings might soon resemble one of those fever charts tracking the meteoric rise in electricity prices last winter but even if his strategy turns out to be a political success a major problem created by the governor s approach will loom as a quiet threat to the state s economy for years to come the centerpiece of his solution to the energy crisis was a series of agreements with electricity generators under which the state will buy power for the next years davis signed those deals in desperation just when prices were peaking with the very companies he has been accusing of gouging the state now that prices have begun to fall davis is taking credit his advisers are even trying to suggest that the existence of the long term contracts has contributed to the more favorable conditions in the market it s economics says david freeman one of the governor s closest energy advisers but the most famous rule of economics the law of supply and demand suggests that the contracts have little if anything to do with the recent decline in electricity prices in a properly functioning market prices decline when supply exceeds demand when demand chases a limited supply prices climb it s true that the contracts have reduced the state s demand for power on the spot market but they also have reduced by an identical amount the supply of electricity available on the spot market that shouldn t have any effect on the price long term contracts used prudently are a fine idea but they are not necessary for a stable market to exist for two years after california s deregulation plan took effect the state s utilities bought power at rock bottom prices without the benefit of any contracts at all by state edict all electricity was bought and sold on the spot market and as long as supply was plentiful the price was low the generators were standing in line to sell us their electricity then a little more than a year ago things went haywire demand caught up with supply and at the same time the price of natural gas which is used to produce most of our electricity rose rapidly the design of the electricity system created by the state also appears to have allowed the private generators to game the market it s still not clear whether their behavior was legal or not but they did gain the upper hand we needed their electrons and the generators suddenly were in the position to demand any price they liked it was at just this moment that davis decided to lock up as much electricity as he could under contract wanting to avoid a retail rate increase that he feared would prove unpopular davis sought the lowest possible price to get it he signed contracts with the longest possible terms shorter terms would have preserved the state s flexibility for the future but the governor said he was willing to pay a price for stability and so he locked every customer of pacific gas electric and southern california edison into his plan some suggest it s unfair to second guess davis now that prices have begun to decline and his contracts are starting to look expensive severin borenstein an economist and energy expert at uc berkeley compares the governor s strategy to buying homeowners insurance if your house doesn t burn down borenstein says that doesn t mean it was a mistake to buy the insurance the trouble is that davis bought his policy after the house was already on fire peter navarro a uc irvine economics professor and consumer advocate warned at the time that the governor was pursuing a faulty strategy he correctly saw then that the same private generators on whom davis was declaring war were rubbing their hands at the prospect of signing deals with the governor at top of the market prices they know there is going to be a highly competitive market in a couple of years navarro told me in march rather than have to fight it out in the spot market at that point of course they d want to lock in year contracts the governor is adopting a long term strategy to address what is essentially a short term problem now with prices drifting back down even sooner than expected navarro is more convinced than ever that davis erred the contracts were bargained in a panic from the utmost position of weakness navarro said last week the cumulative effect of this strategic error will be a cost in the billions it will be like driving the california economy with the emergency brake on voters may never notice the drag but if companies start eyeing lower electricity rates in nevada and arizona and jobs get harder to come by all of california will be paying a long term price for the governor s desire to avoid some short term pain the bee s daniel weintraub can be reached at or at dweintraub sacbee com state generators lock horns in talks davis billion refund call too high judge says by toby eckert copley news service june washington california officials staked out a tough bargaining position yesterday at the start of talks aimed at resolving disputes over refunds and other thorny issues arising from the state s power crisis california s lead negotiator michael kahn called the billion in refunds gov gray davis has demanded from power sellers an extremely conservative estimate and indicated the state would reserve the right to press for more in court the judge overseeing the hearings has called the state s refund estimate too high some power industry sources meanwhile were pessimistic about whether the negotiations would lead to a settlement between the long warring sides given the state s position some representatives from state agencies cities utilities and numerous power generating and marketing firms packed a hearing room at the federal energy regulatory commission for the first day of the talks the negotiators will attempt to settle the state s claim that power sellers have gouged california for more than a year and the sellers contention that they are still owed billions of dollars for power they provided pacific northwest states were also invited into the discussions and are seeking billion in refunds from the power companies the electricity sellers deny wrongdoing saying several factors converged to drive up prices including california s faulty power deregulation law a huge spike in the price of natural gas that is used to generate most electricity in the state and a short supply of electricity speaking to reporters during a break in the closed door session kahn said the state would not trim its estimate of what it believes it is owed for electricity overcharges kahn chairs the independent system operator the organization that manages most of california s power grid let there be no mistake we are not going to ask the courts or ferc in proceedings for billion we re going to ask for a lot more money than that in our litigation position he said the governor has said that he believes ferc should order refunds at billion now ferc chief administrative law judge curtis wagner jr who is mediating the talks has said he believes the refund amount the state is seeking is far too high a more realistic figure would be around billion to billion he said wagner also said that one of the issues up for discussion would be whether power generators should be offered immunity from current and future legal action if a settlement is reached kahn argued that the time period subject to refunds should start in may when power prices started a dramatic upward spiral in california wagner had indicated he would scrutinize prices going back only to october when ferc started examining the market when california officials took the price curbs that ferc approved last week for future power sales and applied them to power charges going back to may the refunds owed to the state would came to roughly billion out of billion in total sales kahn said i am absolutely confident that we have valid legal claims back to may there is no way that we are going to do anything to compromise those claims that includes last summer when san diegans were terribly overcharged kahn said last summer is a very important period to californians that are seeking redress and we are not going to abandon those claims just because ferc has decided not to include them he added wagner asked the california officials to provide more information to back their numbers power sellers continued to maintain that davis estimates of excessive power charges are wildly inflated one group that represents generators gave a bleak prognosis on the chances for a settlement it s hard for us to contemplate how we re going to come to some agreement with players in the room said gary ackerman executive director of the western power trading forum we stand by our business dealings in california said richard wheatley a spokesman for reliant energy one of the companies targeted by the state for refunds our power was priced competitively but wagner a courtly veteran of such complex discussions appeared to take the sparring in stride everybody has to stick to their guns for a while he told reporters after the first day of talks ended everybody has their say and now we re getting ready to get down to brass tacks still the starkly different positions taken by the state and the power sellers illustrate the daunting task facing wagner after months of bitter charges and countercharges between the two sides ferc which ordered the settlement talks as part of its price curb order gave the parties days to reach an agreement if they fail wagner will have an additional seven days to make a recommendation to ferc i can tell you now that you are far better off to work out the refund issue in these settlement proceedings wagner admonished the parties before the hearing room doors were closed to the media the time to put california s past energy problems to rest and structure a new arrangement for california s energy future is now wagner who underlined his role as a broker by sitting among the parties to the talks instead of presiding from the bench also warned the participants not to talk to reporters about specific negotiations while most of the attention has focused on refunds wagner laid out a broad agenda for the talks including moving more power sales in california into long term contracts and away from the volatile spot market ensuring there is a creditworthy party to pay for power in california resolving concerns about the independence of the california grid manager the independent system operator whose board is appointed by davis exploring natural gas issues including transportation constraints and high prices in southern california the bankruptcy of california s largest utility pacific gas and electric which sought protection from creditors after it was unable to pay soaring wholesale power costs davis commends heroes in generator refunds fight by bill ainsworth union tribune staff writer june sacramento gov gray davis praised three former employees at duke energy s chula vista plant as heroes yesterday for coming forward with allegations that duke policies created power shortages that raised electricity prices for the second time in recent days the three plant veterans dominated events in sacramento with explosive allegations of mismanagement and market manipulation by a company that has reaped enormous profits in california ed edwards glenn johnson and jimmy olkjer made those claims under oath on friday before a state senate committee davis and other democratic politicians yesterday said these first insider accounts of how power plant operations might have manipulated prices will help the state in its attempt to get billion in refunds from duke and other energy generating companies there s no question in my mind a lot of money has been stolen from california and these men are going to help us get it back said assemblywoman barbara matthews d tracy the ex employees told davis that duke risked jeopardizing equipment by constantly powering the megawatt plant up and down dumped new spare parts and took working turbines off line for economic reasons davis said the power plant workers confirmed his suspicions that north carolina based duke and other companies engaged in price gouging there s a concerted effort to suck every dime out of california and send it back to houston or north carolina he said davis cautioned that he hadn t yet heard duke s version of events the company is entitled to their point of view he said but they ve got some explaining to do duke energy spokesman tom williams called the governor s meeting with the former workers unfair and unproductive williams said a review of company logs shows that during a stage energy alert the chula vista plant powered down under orders from california s electricity grid manager the independent system operator he said the company was doing its job by supplying the state with spinning reserves that could be added to the system in minutes to balance the load that is to make sure that supply equaled demand iso spokeswoman stephanie mccorkle said the agency buys four types of ancillary services to balance the load including spinning reserves but she said only duke can release information from jan williams said duke soon plans to release logs from that day and several others meanwhile another former chula vista plant employee confirmed the allegations of the other three workers all of them had worked for san diego gas electric when the utility owned the plant before duke took over its operation duke was required to keep the sdg e employees on for two years but it then let many of them go rick connors a former operator who turned down an offer from duke to stay on at the south bay plant said the plant output frequently was down for economic reasons the governor brought up those allegations during a subsequent meeting with two new ferc commissioners pat wood and nora brownell davis asked the federal regulators to look into possible price gouging the high price of natural gas and the billion in refunds he is seeking after meeting with davis wood said he thinks california will emerge from the energy crisis in or and become an energy trendsetter he said he believes california leaders have the will to build more power plants and improve natural gas pipelines that fuel new generators but he cautioned that there will be some short term pain i think you folks will seem some blackouts this summer he said staff writer ed mendel contributed to this report san onofre blast released no radiation spokesman says but motorists on i weren t so sure by bruce lieberman union tribune staff writer june san onofre charlene engel was driving with a few friends up interstate sunday when she saw flames and smoke shoot suddenly skyward from the nuclear power plant pieces of silvery material were fluttering through the air and drifting toward the freeway traffic began speeding up everybody sort of saw it and thought oh my god have we just been irradiated or what said engel a rancho bernardo artist in fact the explosion of a transformer was far outside the twin reactors at the san onofre nuclear generating station and posed no radiation danger ray golden a plant spokesman said yesterday but engel and her friends who were heading to the los angeles county museum of art for a winslow homer exhibit didn t know that you don t actually know how things are hooked up so you don t want to hang around engel said we moved north pretty quickly santee resident richard carrico whose niece was driving him to dana point said the fireball rose about feet my god i thought she was going to faint said carrico no one was injured in the explosion which occurred at a m and was followed by a fire that lasted about minutes the transformer was destroyed but no other equipment at the plant was damaged and the twin reactors continued to operate at full power without interruption golden said yesterday san onofre investigators were still trying to figure out why the transformer failed they should have some answers and a new transformer installed in about a week the transformer was one of in the plant s switching yard used to reduce the voltage of a sample of outgoing electricity the so called potential transformers step down the current sample to volts so instruments can test the amperage and wattage electricity leaves san onofre at volts in transmission lines the explosion scattered shards of ceramic and aluminum debris and gallons of burning insulation oil hundreds of feet golden said pieces of the transformer some as large as one foot square landed on old highway plant operators feared debris would land on i but the california highway patrol did not report any there a dispatcher said the chp received several calls from drivers reporting a fireball the last time a potential transformer exploded at the plant s switching yard was in golden said plant workers discovered that corrosion caused by ocean air rusted the transformer s carbon steel casing allowing water to enter and contaminate the insulation oil after that the plant replaced four transformers and repaired three all are periodically washed down with high pressure fire hoses to prevent corrosion golden said he would not speculate on the cause of the latest explosion or whether it could lead to the replacement of other transformers if the root cause shows that it needs to be repaired or replaced it will he said although sunday s explosion did not shut down the plant or release any radiation it was the latest in a string of mishaps this year on feb a faulty circuit breaker ignited a fire and cut off

meetings by scott lindlaw associated press june washington congressional investigators are intensifying pressure on the white house to identify who met privately with vice president dick cheney s energy task force the general accounting office has sent cheney s lawyer a page letter asserting a legal right to the lists and advising cheney that it may make a formal demand for the information rather than the polite requests it has made in recent weeks comptroller general david m walker is prepared to issue a demand letter if we do not receive timely access to the information the gao said in a page letter dated friday from office general counsel anthony h gamboa to david s addington attorney for the vice president the gao is the investigative arm of congress and it has legal authority to federal agency records under the law a demand letter could begin a legal battle it would give cheney s office days to respond either by turning over the names or providing a reason why it is not compelled to do so said lynn gibson a lawyer for the gao if cheney declined to turn over the records the gao would notify congress and attorney general john ashcroft among others the gao would also be authorized to file a civil action in court seeking the record gibson said she knew of no previous case in which the gao was forced to go to court to obtain agency records the white house team that developed the national energy plan released last month met with more than interest groups from environmentalists and unions often at odds with republicans to major bush supporters who got private sessions with cheney reps henry waxman d calif and john dingell d mich in april asked the gao to provide information on who served on the task force what information was presented to the panel who presented it and what the task force spent the white house has asserted that the gao does not have the authority to ask for names of participants however it agreed that the gao is entitled to financial records of the task force and two administration officials said the vice president s office provided pages of financial documents to the gao last week the gao contends it is entitled to a wider range of records federal law extends gao s audit authority to all matters related to the use of public money not just matters related to costs of activities it argued in its letter to cheney over the years gao has conducted many reviews that involve a wide range of white house programs and activities juleanna glover weiss a spokeswoman for cheney declined to comment on the gao s assertions other than to say i m sure the gao and the vice president s office will be talking about that waxman and dingell called on cheney to provide the information they seek the vice president should stop stonewalling and start cooperating with gao s investigation waxman said monday congress is entitled to know the identity of the special interests that met with the cheney energy task force creditor expects no quick fix in pg e s venture into bankruptcy by ed mendel june sacramento california s biggest utility pacific gas and electric thought it was moving toward an early exit from the power crisis by filing for chapter bankruptcy in early april the top pg e executive robert glynn optimistically told a wall street publication that he hoped a settlement might be negotiated with creditors in four to six months but an official with one of the parties on the pg e creditors committee which includes the bank of america and the state of tennessee said he does not see a quick end to the bankruptcy my personal opinion david adante executive vice president of davey tree surgery said last week is that it s going to take longer than everyone would like adante said he thinks a resolution is likely to go beyond the bankruptcy court and involve the state public utilities commission gov gray davis and perhaps the legislature the rate part won t be resolved in the bankruptcy process said adante davey tree surgery which is based in kent ohio trims trees that encroach on power lines for several california utilities pg e owes davey tree million making it one of the smallest creditors on a committee that includes big power providers enron and dynegy and big wall street firms morgan guaranty and merrill lynch a turning point in the pg e bankruptcy may have come earlier this month when the federal bankruptcy judge dennis montali declared that electricity rates should be set by state regulators experts disagreed about whether a bankruptcy judge could order a rate change for a utility without the approval of state regulators in this case the puc the public interest is better served by deference to the regulatory scheme and leaving the entire regulatory function to the regulator montali ruled pg e said it entered bankruptcy because the regulatory process failed denying a rate increase last fall that might have prevented the utility from running up what it says is a debt of at least billion pg e also said the political process failed when among other things the governor s negotiator broke a handshake agreement that included the state purchase of pg e s transmission system but we have said all along that intersection with the regulatory and political process would probably reoccur a pg e spokesman said last week the legislature after months of delay held a hearing last week on the governor s plan to keep southern california edison out of bankruptcy which includes the state purchase of the edison transmission system legislative leaders say the plan is too generous to edison undaunted davis hopes to win legislative approval of some version of his edison plan and then persuade the pg e creditors committee to accept a similar plan but even if davis can get his rescue plan approved by the legislature and the pg e committee it s likely to be challenged with a ballot initiative by consumer groups who denounce the proposal as a bailout for utilities meanwhile the period in which only pg e can file a bankruptcy reorganization plan ends aug allowing creditors or other parties to make proposals and if the legislature does not act by aug the agreement that the governor negotiated with edison can be waived by either party but of course as with most things in the electricity crisis the deadlines could be extended ed mendel is capitol bureau chief for the union tribune state power firms urged to make a deal energy mediator says a refund pact would benefit both sides meanwhile davis tones down his rhetoric as regulators come calling by megan garvey and dan morain times staff writers washington after being vilified for months by gov gray davis federal energy regulators here and in sacramento took steps monday to show they are determined to respond to california s energy crisis a top federal regulator began mediating davis demand for nearly billion in what the governor says are overcharges by power generators and warned a room full of dark suited lawyers energy executives and state officials here that they will be far better off if they decide among themselves how big a refund the state is due meanwhile in sacramento patrick h wood iii and nora m brownell president bush s first appointees to the five member federal energy regulatory commission spent the afternoon conferring with davis and legislative leaders then they held a fact finding hearing with california regulators on the high price of natural gas the fuel that spins most new electricity turbines in california we re going to be working together through tough issues brownell said we re going to work through them and solve them and move forward it is a lot easier when people have sat down and gotten to know each other davis has been attacking federal energy regulators a majority of whom are holdovers from the clinton administration for failing to take a variety of steps to bail california out of its energy woes on monday however davis toned down his bellicose attacks on the federal commission brownell and wood davis said are committed to working together with us to drive down the price of natural gas in california to get it closer to what the rest of the country is paying i think we are turning a corner davis said as temperatures across the state were moderate and electricity demand was low conservation has been spectacular californians have responded heroically the federal government is now finally taking some positive actions the outlook looks much more positive than it did two months ago the developments in washington and sacramento come as davis issues campaign style demands for more aid from the federal government and as polls show that voters are skeptical of how davis and bush are handling california s energy crisis republican lawmakers in sacramento contend that the regulatory commission has granted davis virtually everything he has sought the commission earlier this month imposed temporary price restraints a step davis said is helping to lower wholesale electricity prices paid by the state senate republican leader jim brulte said monday that he has no doubt the commission known as ferc will order power generators to issue refunds to california as davis has requested but brulte of rancho cucamonga also predicted that davis will find the order wanting the governor s game is a political one the davis administration has a clear strategy that no matter what ferc does it isn t enough in washington the roughly participants who showed up for day one of a day settlement conference on refunds showed little sign they were ready to agree at least not yet for now the differences remain considerable about billion in refunds demanded by california s representatives at the talks plus billion more that other western states say they have been unfairly charged power generators hotly dispute those figures the time to put california s past energy problems to rest and structure a new arrangement for california s energy future is now said curtis l wagner the chief administrative law judge for ferc we can do it if we try wagner who told reporters last week he believed refunds of about billion were probably justified is mediating the closed door talks davis is asking that the refunds cover the period since may these out of state energy companies are taking us for a ride davis said in a brief interview in sacramento on monday i am determined to get every penny back that california is owed the generators have bilked us mercilessly and i m fighting back i m not giving up nothing consumers wouldn t see refunds directly rather the money would go to the state or to private utilities such as southern california edison for electricity purchases made during the energy crisis participants in the washington meeting represent about entities with stakes in the electricity dispute if they fail to reach agreement among themselves within the allotted days wagner will have seven days to make a formal recommendation of his own to ferc s five member governing board the settlement negotiations are confidential wagner promised those present he would shred his notes and transcripts at their completion he allowed reporters in the hearing room where oversized pots of coffee perched on every table only long enough to listen to his opening remarks and to a prepared statement he read from two of the five ferc commissioners wagner who asked that all sides send advocates with the authority to reach an agreement said the issues to be resolved include refunds for past electricity purchases including how much money is involved and who needs to be paid moving additional quantities of electricity off the spot market and into long term contracts ensuring that generators receive payment for electricity already provided the bankruptcy of pacific gas electric wagner said the talks also should address whether any settlement provides generators with immunity from existing and future lawsuits and prosecutions the statement from ferc commissioners wood and brownell encouraged participants to focus on what they absolutely need and not what they want but sorting out which is which may prove challenging the head of california s delegation for example reiterated davis demands for billion in refunds we want our refunds we want them now michael kahn one of davis top energy advisors told reporters during a break in the negotiations kahn said the officials he is representing the governor state legislators the electricity oversight board and the public utilities commission consider the billion figure to be an extremely conservative estimate he indicated the delegation had little interest in relinquishing the right to sue for additional funds even if power generators offered to make refunds for time periods before the oct cutoff that ferc has proposed as they have in the past electricity generators staked out a far different position characterizing as absurd the state s overcharge estimate we ve done absolutely nothing wrong said tom williams a spokesman for duke energy co adding that his company was gratified that all the parties are at the table to discuss this the settlement negotiations were mandated by ferc last week as the agency put in place an expanded price mitigation plan for western electricity markets garvey

edition page c copyright the times mirror company with its wall of fins abstract patterns and varying surfaces and colors colorado court in santa monica is shaping up to be a real head turner but the apartment complex is no mere exercise in style over substance what makes the project groundbreaking in power starved california is that it will generate nearly all its own energy electricity heat and hot water all from alternative technologies the unit complex at th street and colorado avenue scheduled to open in october will be adorned with solar panels which will supply about a third of the building s electricity the rest of the power will come primarily from a micro turbine a generator that runs on clean burning natural gas southern california edison will supply only a fraction of the

the window is an assemblage of many solar panels the rear of the building is covered in an abstract pattern of vertical fins the fins shade the building s southern face from direct sunlight sensible concept for low income tenants although some may be surprised that a building intended for low income residents is the beneficiary of expensive energy technology the concept makes sense for people with limited incomes said robin raida project manager for the builder community corp of santa monica energy efficiency is especially important in affordable housing because our tenants don t have extra money to spend on high utility bills she said a host of public and private entities including the cities of santa monica and irvine southern california edison and the california energy coalition are involved in planning funding and monitoring the innovative building the two cities the conservation group and the utility have formed a group known as regional energy efficiency initiative which has contributed about to energy saving devices in the building in addition santa monica itself is contributing about toward electricity generators the building will be loaded with energy saving and environmentally benign or sustainable devices heat from the micro turbine will produce hot water eliminating the need for a conventional water heater the project also uses compact fluorescent lighting throughout the building insulation made from recycled material and double pane windows with a layer of heat retardant krypton gas each apartment will be equipped with energy saving refrigerators that do not use chlorofluorocarbons the widely used refrigerant linked to damage in the earth s ozone layer prevailing breezes will cool the building which will have no mechanical air conditioners the u

contaminated water from spilling into santa monica bay the drainage system was paid for separately by the city of santa monica the concept of a building that would be energy self sufficient emerged about two years ago when santa monica officials met with members of the california energy coalition the city s housing division which funds construction of low income housing chose to make a low income housing project into a dream project of green construction and colorado court became the target we needed a demonstration project because a lot of developers feel that the technologies are unproven raida said a number of apartment buildings in santa monica and irvine are to be equipped with energy saving technology by the regional energy efficiency initiative but the santa monica building is the only project attempting to provide its own power as well rebates from the state energy commission helped defray the high cost of the energy generating equipment the state s rebate on the solar panels which cost about will be about the micro turbine and heat exchanger will yield a rebate from southern california gas co if recent research and development has yielded new ways of conserving energy and producing electricity regulations and building codes have not kept pace prospects uncertain for conventional buildings in one instance architects had to obtain special permission from the city to hang solar panels outside the exterior stairwells because building inspectors said the solar panels enclosed the stairwells and triggered requirements for floors ceilings and fire rated walls if energy saving devices and electrical generators make sense for a building that has in subsidies do the same costly materials make sense for a conventional apartment building opinions vary even with rebates the added cost of the conservation and energy generating equipment may be a hard sell for developers of market rate apartment units such developers often sell their projects shortly after completion and might not be able to fetch a higher price for energy efficient buildings for a nonprofit like community corp which plans to retain ownership of its buildings for years the added front end cost could be worthwhile because the equipment will hold down energy costs for low income tenants for years california metro desk officials oppose utility choice power they say users leaving traditional firms could jeopardize state s repayment of billion in energy purchases tim reiterman los angeles times home edition page b copyright the times mirror company consumer choice was a mantra when california moved in to restructure its electricity industry but the right of utility customers to shop around for power is falling victim to the state s own strategy to drag itself from the energy debacle warning of a spiral of declining customers and rising power rates top state officials are calling for swift action to curtail the freedom of utility patrons to buy from alternative electricity providers they fear that california s ability to pay for nearly billion in past and future electricity purchases would be jeopardized unless regulators or legislators suspend or restrict the state s so called direct access program a flight of customers from the traditional utilities the officials say would saddle the remaining businesses and consumers with paying off an unfair share of those billions under direct access thousands of utility customers ranging from big commercial and industrial users to environmentally aware residential consumers who wanted green power signed up with companies promising lower prices better service or the security of long term contracts but the energy crisis changed all that in january the state s department of water resources became the major electricity purchaser for most californians as skyrocketing wholesale prices put pacific gas electric co and southern california edison deeply into debt and many suppliers refused to sell to them the same legislation that authorized the department s purchases called on the california public utilities commission to suspend direct access until the state stops buying power which could be almost two decades under some of the long term contracts the state has signed with suppliers the commission is poised to vote thursday on a proposal to suspend direct access by july and it is expected to pass bills in the legislature would resurrect the program while requiring new customers to pay exit fees designed to protect the state s planned billion bond sale for electricity purchases but the proposals have been mired in negotiations in any case state officials say they can ill afford to lose big commercial and industrial users as utility customers help pay off the state s current billion power tab and more than billion in long term power contracts if such customers are permitted to exit the system without paying their share of costs incurred by dwr the burden of covering debt service payments will fall on a smaller base of remaining customers significantly and unfairly increasing their power rates said a june memo from state treasurer phil angelides and the heads of the finance and water resources departments to the puc and the legislature there is a concern that as power rates paid by the remaining customers would rise customers would have additional economic incentive to abandon dwr power creating a spiral of declining customers and rising power rates the memo said statewide the total number of direct access customers has fallen from a peak of more than to about in mid may figures from the california energy commission show that these customers including hotel and hospital chains factories farms the state s university systems and about residences accounted for about of the power consumed in california the level of participation by residential customers was about a third as high as for large commercial and industrial customers the penetration rates were much higher early this year when about of industrial users had direct access contracts but many providers sent their customers back to edison pg e and san diego gas electric as wholesale energy costs soared and they could not compete with the utilities whose rates were frozen by the deregulation law one provider aes newenergy claims to customers ranging from mom and pop stores to grocery chains about a year ago the company had to customers direct access is at the heart of the concept of competition and choice said aaron thomas the company s manager of government relations the puc order stinks and it is not necessary to put a stake in the heart of direct access to float a bond said rick counihan a spokesman for green mountain energy unless we see a legislative solution direct access is dead we re being driven out of california green mountain a vermont based company that sells power from renewable sources has seen its california customer base shrink from to all in san diego and orange counties although they have never fled en masse to direct access many businesses and institutions want to maintain direct access as an option especially because it is uncertain whether the state s power contracts will prove to be a bargain or a bust in the long run bill dombrowski president of the california retailers assn representing more than large companies said it is important to maintain direct access as an option because the market is in a shambles at its peak before the market was dysfunctional you saw to reductions in electricity rates compared to local utilities which is significant dollars when you are talking about larger companies he said like other proponents dombrowski maintains that the fears expressed by state officials and wall street bond underwriters are exaggerated realistically you will not see a wave of people going to direct access he said the utilities commission measure which would halt new direct access enrollments was put off until this week in hopes that a solution could be worked out in sacramento puc commissioner jeff brown one of three appointees of gov gray davis on the five member commission said that like the governor he favors direct access on philosophical grounds but sees no way to avoid suspending the program we are tied up in the realities of the bond sale he said if the legislature wants to do something in the future fine commissioner richard bilas another supporter of direct access acknowledges that it could at the margins jeopardize the bond sale but direct access he said is what restructuring was about in the first place without it you no longer have restructuring advocates of direct access remain hopeful that a legislative solution could balance the desires of the business community and the bond

sherman associated press writer tuesday june associated press url ial edt dtl pdt washington ap energy users and providers are billions of dollars apart in their estimates of how much the power crisis in the western states has cost the federal official overseeing confidential settlement talks wants them to come to terms quickly with just two weeks to reach agreement federal energy regulatory commission chief administrative law judge curtis l wagner said he wants all sides to start using realistic numbers when they meet tuesday for the second day of negotiations now we re getting ready to get down to brass tacks wagner said monday after the first day of talks led by california western states say power generating companies overcharged them by billion in the past year michael kahn california s chief negotiator said the billion in refunds his state claims it is owed should be the first order of business we want our refunds we want them now said kahn chairman of the california independent system operator which manages the state s power grid the states claim that the companies unfairly drove up prices to take advantage of a power shortage prices frequently surpassed a megawatt hour times what they were in one megawatt is enough to power about homes the power companies argue that the charges were justified in some cases older more costly power plants were pressed into service to deal with the high demand and tight supply wagner attributed the states claims to the rhetorical flourishes that often accompany the start of negotiations everybody has to stick to their guns for a while he said the judge who is playing a mediator s role in the negotiations said he has seen nothing to change his previously stated view that refunds in any settlement probably would not exceed billion he cautioned all sides that a brokered settlement would be preferable to a plan he would recommend to federal regulators should talks fail more than people representing about six dozen entities gathered in a government hearing room for negotiations the talks were one result of a federal order last week extending price controls on spot power sales in california and imposing limits in other western states wagner laid out several issues negotiators will have to tackle including how much generators are owed for power they supplied to california without getting paid the size of the refunds and the unpaid bills must be both ways resolved at the outset to put everyone on the same playing field wagner said any settlement probably would also have to answer whether the generators should have immunity from existing and future lawsuits and prosecution he said the parties also have to try to reach agreement on additional long term power contracts which would reduce the amount of power california would have to purchase on the volatile spot market the attendees included representatives from california and a dozen city and county governments investor owned and

chronicle washington bureau tuesday june san francisco chronicle url n dtl washington with armies of lawyers on each side california officials and representatives of the nation s power generators began the first day of federally ordered settlement talks yesterday far apart on the issue of electricity refunds california officials including attorneys for the investor owned utilities stuck to their claim that the state was owed nearly billion in alleged overcharges by the generators but electricity suppliers were equally adamant in their opposition to refunds arguing the prices they charged were legitimate suppliers are demanding payment for billions of dollars they are owed for electricity already sold into the state the mediator in the talks veteran federal energy regulatory commission administrative law judge curtis l wagner jr warned both sides they would have to compromise or accept a settlement imposed by federal regulators the time to put california s past energy problems to rest and structure a new arrangement for california s energy future is now wagner said we can do it if we try the difficulty of the task was made clear when the judge asked those in the hearing room yesterday to stand and identify themselves about people nearly all lawyers stood to declare which state city power exchange or generator they represented in addition to a host of energy firms other western states are involved in the talks officials in washington and oregon say they may ask for up to billion in refunds wagner opened the talks by reading a letter from new ferc commissioners patrick wood and nora mead brownell urging both sides to compromise parties must only focus on what they absolutely need not what they want the statement read this is not the place to debate the shopping list nor is it the place to assign blame if the parties can t settle the money fight in days wagner will have seven days to recommend action to ferc s five commissioners i can tell you now that you are far better off to work out the refund issue in these settlement proceedings than to have me recommend an answer to the commission wagner said as the talks started in washington wood and brownell met yesterday in sacramento with gov gray davis legislative leaders and other groups involved in solving the energy crisis davis said in a statement that he was more encouraged by ferc s actions recently since the two joined the regulatory body in a refreshing change these commissioners offered a problem solving approach in resolving california s energy challenge davis said wood expressed optimism the settlement talks would be fruitful i think it is far better to settle than to stretch out through litigation even if the state were to ultimately prevail he said this is really about businesspeople who need to re establish a business relationship that has been poisoned although the divide between california officials and the generators is vast some have faith in the mediator a year old judge with a track record of reaching settlements in difficult cases he s a miracle worker said ferc commissioner william massey he s very good at persuading parties that it s in their best interests to settle rather than proceed with lawsuits wagner set the tone yesterday by ordering reporters out of the hearing room after half an hour explaining the ground rules and wagner warned participants to keep the discussions confidential i would hate to read something in the business section tomorrow that somebody said here today wagner said michael kahn chairman of california s independent system operator said the state would hold firm to its request for billion in refunds any refunds would go to the electricity buyers the utilities and the department of water resources which has bought energy on behalf of the state since january but to suppliers even the word refund is an unacceptable term certainly you will not find a supplier who will agree that they have been overcharging anyone in california so clearly any refund obligation will be contested said mark stultz a vice president of the electric power supply association which represents the generators the suppliers will argue the charges were appropriate for the market conditions state officials may face difficulty recovering the full amount based on electricity sales from may to may under ferc rules overcharges can only be authorized after a formal investigation is ordered which began oct there is no way that we re going to do anything to compromise those claims kahn said that includes last summer when san diegans were terribly overcharged that includes last summer when there were no credit problems and the gas situation was not anywhere near as severe as it was later in the year and still there were hideous electricity prices power issues these are some of the items administrative law judge curtis l wagner jr expects to tackle during settlement talks between western state officials and power generators california s claim that the generators overcharged the state by nearly billion for electricity generators claims of overdue payments estimated at several billion dollars

billions of dollars are at stake as legal teams from california its utilities and dozens of power suppliers try to negotiate a settlement by july the federal energy regulatory commission set up the settlement conference to resolve california s claims that energy suppliers have overcharged the state billion for power since last spring the commission has ordered about million in refunds for a small portion of that time power companies balk at the suggestion they overcharged saying it is they who are owed billions by state utilities that haven t paid their bills for electricity purchases

confidential talks began the time to put california s past energy problems to rest and structure a new arrangement for california s energy future is now we can do it if we try early indications were that a settlement will be difficult although state and federal officials in sacramento talked with optimism about a new level of cooperation but at the meeting in washington the head of california s team gave no ground monday reiterating the state s position that it wants all of the billion gov gray davis demanded during congressional testimony last week michael kahn chairman of the state s independent system operator said that all the parties in california the governor the attorney general the iso the public utilities commission and the three investor owned utilities are presenting a unified front we are all together along with representatives from the legislature kahn said in saying the same thing to ferc and saying the same thing to the generators we want our refunds we want them now and we want that to be the first order of business kahn said the billion figure is bolstered by initial estimates by the state of overcharges if a new price limit formula approved by the commission last week had been in effect since may the total is an extremely conservative estimate he said and the state will ask for a lot more money if the issue is referred to the commission for action or if the whole dispute goes to court the total amount of electricity purchases by california and its utilities during that month period was billion but how far back the state could seek refunds is one of several issues wagner said must be determined in the settlement talks the commission has said it has authority to order refunds only from last october though everything is subject to negotiations wagner said last week he believes the amount suppliers owe the state is about billion the state estimates it was overcharged billion from may to september according to a confidential iso breakdown obtained by the mercury news the breakdown of alleged overcharges by suppliers goes only through february when the state estimated overcharges at billion a figure recently updated through the end of may to billion for the whole period from may to february the biggest over chargers were williams energy services corp million duke energy trading and marketing million and southern company energy marketing million other concerns among other subjects to be negotiated are who should get refunds and immunity for suppliers from future lawsuits for overcharges in convening the negotiations ferc commissioners said they hoped many issues could be addressed in addition to refunds including more long term contracts between the state and power suppliers at the end of the first day of talks wagner said the state and some others were digging in in all about parties sent representatives ranging from energy suppliers to utilities to municipalities wagner admonished them all to keep the talks confidential everybody has to stick to their guns for a while he said noting the negotiations may have to go late into the evenings and into weekends to meet the deadline in sacramento on monday the newest commissioners to join ferc pat wood and nora brownell praised california for its handling of the energy crisis wood a texan appointed by president bush and expected to become the next ferc chairman said he had come to california to help patch up the state s strained relationship with federal regulators after meeting with davis and legislative leaders wood said he was more hopeful today than i was at any time in the past year they are very committed to getting this energy cowboy back on the bucking bronco he said davis who has bashed bush and federal regulators for weeks also changed his tone from my conversations with these commissioners it appears that ferc may finally be poised to do its job controlling energy costs he said in a prepared statement mercury news staff writer dion nissenbaum contributed to this report power workers supported earlier testimony about deliberate manipulation of power plants is backed up by a new group of employees june by kimberly kindy the orange county register sacramento a second wave of former power plant workers stepped forward monday to say they witnessed power merchants intentionally damage generators including some in orange county a practice they believe led to price gouging of californians the generating companies duke energy and aes corp also denied the new round of allegations made by a half dozen workers who took their stories public or contacted legislators with offers to provide sworn testimony one of those speaking out monday a former manager at duke s chula vista plant told the orange county register that he supports the testimony of three former colleagues who friday told a senate committee that new parts at the plant were destroyed routine maintenance was neglected and generators were unnecessarily throttled down rick connors said that unlike the three chula vista plant workers who testified earlier he was offered continued employment by duke and cannot be dismissed by the company as a terminated employee with an ax to grind i listened to the entire hearing i can tell you that everything they said was the truth nothing they said was even a stretch said connors who has decided to retire and become a card dealer instead of working for duke which took over the plant from san diego gas electric and laid off many of his experienced co workers connors and another new witness dan davis a former electrician at the aes owned huntington beach plant each on monday said they saw maintenance schedules at their respective plants abandoned and generators constantly turned on and off which damaged them they learned that they would operate one generator and make more money than if they were operating three said connors conners had worked at the plant years before duke took it over in and said he was familiar with generation levels before and after the takeover conners said that even though duke dramatically cut back on how much it ran its generators in the first year duke executives boasted to employees at a company party that they had made as much money in their first year as sdg e had made in the previous five similarly davis said the generators at the aes plant in huntington beach would be ramped down and quickly ramped up again he believes this wear and tear coupled with a lack of maintenance not only helped create an immediate scarcity in the market but also created an environment of constant breakdowns which created further scarcity at first i thought they were stupid said davis who now works for the union representing plant workers i had been there years and i was watching them destroy the plant but then i saw how it made them money breakdowns made them money both companies vigorously denied the allegations any talk of us intentionally breaking down equipment is ludicrous said ed blackford manager of the aes plant when our units break down we lose money we have commitments and if we can t produce that electricity we have to go out into the market and buy it duke spokesman tom williams said he is sure the workers saw changes in the way the plants were operated after deregulation but said their conclusions of price fixing and gouging are off base it s highly offensive to us said williams they were seeing things from their own viewpoint and they don t see the full picture duke took out a full page ad in today s orange county register and other newspapers that says the powering up and down was done at the order of the independent system operator which manages the state s power grid williams acknowledged however that some of those orders were made by duke itself but couldn t say what percentage the advertisement doesn t address the allegation that equipment was intentionally mistreated or replacement parts scrapped although duke said earlier that the parts were obsolete and it was more cost efficient to order parts as needed iso spokeswoman stephanie mccorkle said its orders to power suppliers to ramp generators up and down are confidential and she could not verify williams explanation however the iso she said would give duke orders to ramp up and down no more often than every minutes a review of three days of logs obtained by the register showed that on more than a dozen occasions orders were given in two three or four minute intervals the so called dramatic yo yoing of the generators that some legislators say indicates duke was acting by itself williams said the bottom line is that forced outages at the chula vista plant were done under duke s control just percent of the time compared to percent under sdg e those numbers however are disputed frank wolak a stanford economics professor who oversees the iso s market surveillance committee said the forced outage numbers have only been reliable for the past six months there is no independent verification of these numbers until jan until the governor required that they report this information every single day wolak said that information isn t any good wolak also said the employees are correct about the destructive results of the constant ramping up and down comparing it to the wear and tear on a car that travels through a succession of city traffic lights vs a clear freeway the governor monday stood by the three former chula vista workers who testified friday calling them brave individuals i am enormously proud of these people who would step forward risk the harassment and retaliation these big energy companies are known for davis said just before having breakfast with the men judge sets tone at energy talks he suggests that all sides including the state delegation would be better off settling june by dena bunis the orange county register washington on the first day of talks over how to settle billions of dollars of refund claims and other issues surrounding california s electricity crisis a federal energy judge gave a friendly warning to the more than people in his hearing room i can tell you now that you are far better off to work out the refund issue in these settlement hearings than to have me recommend an answer to the commission curtis l wagner chief administrative law judge for the federal energy regulatory commission said monday the ferc ordered a day settlement conference for stakeholders in the electricity crisis to resolve such issues as alleged generator overcharges how much generators still have to sell to california and the future of long term contracts the first day ended where it began california wants billion worth of refunds michael kahn chairman of california s independent system operator and gov gray davis representative at the talks said during a break kahn and the rest of the state delegation met for minutes with wagner on monday afternoon kahn then got on a plane for california the state has until wednesday to produce more information for the judge wagner later met with power sellers in an effort to understand their position which is that the state s refund figure is laughable now we re ready to get down to brass tacks wagner said the veteran energy jurist wasn t phased by kahn s and davis hard line on the billion refund figure even though wagner signaled last week that a couple of billion in refunds is more likely everybody has to stick to their guns for a while wagner said the judge wouldn t say how he arrived at his refund estimate but within davis billion estimate is more than billion that he says is owed to the state by entities over which the ferc has no control such as municipal power companies in addition the state has calculated the billion based on alleged overcharges from may to may the ferc began calculating overcharges in october there s no way kahn said that the state will abandon its overcharge claims for last summer the first day s proceedings were largely theater the conference started with a statement from wagner including his reading of a letter from new ferc commissioners patrick wood and nora brownell both of whom were in sacramento on monday researching the natural gas issue this is not the place to debate the shopping list the letter said nor is it a place to assign blame everyone must leave with something more than they came in with then representatives from the power sellers the utilities the state and interests from throughout the west introduced themselves to each other after that wagner closed the conference and admonished all the parties not to talk about what goes on in the closed hearing room business financial desk section c california and energy providers in talks over electric fees by joseph kahn the new york times page column c new york times company washington june for the first time since the end of the clinton administration california and the companies that sell it electricity sat at the same table today to try to resolve a multibillion dollar feud over the state s energy bills california is demanding that power companies refund as much as billion for what it says were overcharges while power companies say that the state s nearly insolvent utilities owe them billions of dollars city and state officials from across the west are also participating in the negotiations the federal energy regulatory commission convened the talks which are scheduled to last up to two weeks the sessions are the first since top clinton administration officials tried and failed to broker a settlement to california s electricity crisis in their waning days in office the time to put california s past energy problems to rest and structure a new arrangement for california s energy future is now said curtis wagner an administrative law judge for the energy commission who is presiding over the settlement talks the proceeding which was standing room only on opening day attracted scores of people representing multiple sides in the dispute the main participants are electricity generating companies electric utilities and public officials from state and local governments and regulatory agencies mr wagner urged the public officials and companies involved to reach an agreement on how much california and other states in the western grid should have paid for power over the last year when california s partly deregulated market broke down he said that if they failed to do so by july he would recommend a solution to the energy agency s five commissioners who would then have the option of imposing a settlement wholesale power costs in california which totaled billion in soared to about billion last year and by some state estimates could double again this year the higher costs which have not been fully passed along to consumers have rendered california s two main utility companies unable to pay their bills and forced the state to buy power in their place the opening bid by gov gray davis who set out his views in a letter sent to the energy commission today is that the leading electricity generators should refund about billion that they have overcharged the people of the state of california michael kahn chairman of the california independent system operator is leading the state delegation generating companies have dismissed that figure as grossly inflated they acknowledge that prices are high but they say the charges are linked to shortages of natural gas a crucial fuel for electricity generation and were set fairly in a free market the companies also contend that a large proportion of what they have billed california is a credit premium justified because wobbly utilities owe them as much as billion reliant energy duke energy the williams companies the enron corporation and the mirant corporation are among the major sellers of electricity in the western region the energy commission which has the duty of determining just and reasonable electricity prices under a new deal era law long ago found that the california market had become dysfunctional and that prices were unjustified but the agency has struggled to come up with a method for determining fair rates changing its method three times in recent months so far the agency has identified about million in potential overcharges but that number was reached using a restrictive method that the agency has since abandoned last week the agency adopted a new price control regime that is intended to limit price spikes throughout the west if the controls it is using now were retroactively applied to electricity sales made over the last year the generators would be asked to refund much more money by some estimates the refunds could total more than billion but seem likely to fall well short of the billion california is seeking national desk section a cheney withholds list of those who spoke to energy panel by joseph kahn the new york times page column c new york times company washington june vice president dick cheney has declined to identify the people who met privately with his energy task force raising tensions with congressional investigators who have repeatedly requested the information the general accounting office an investigative arm of congress sent mr cheney s office a letter late last week complaining that a month had passed since it first submitted an inquiry about the workings of the task force the letter said the vice president had a legal obligation to provide the information immediately mr cheney s office said the letter was sent one day after it submitted pages of documents to the accounting office our correspondence crossed in the mail said juleanna glover weiss a spokeswoman for mr cheney but ms weiss said the vice president had not provided the names of people including industry executives who may have influenced the formation of the bush administration s energy policy which was released last month our counsel and the g a o will continue to talk about this ms weiss said the energy task force mr cheney headed spent several months compiling a lengthy energy strategy that contained about recommendations for administrative and legislative actions to address what it termed an energy crisis administration officials have said that they met with a wide variety of people concerned about energy issues including executives of oil natural gas electricity nuclear power and energy infrastructure companies they have declined to provide a list of people who had access to the task force some democrats have asserted that leading republican donors had special access to the task force and that the energy policy is skewed toward measures favored by major corporations two democratic representatives henry a waxman of california and john d dingell of michigan asked the accounting office to report on the officials who served on the task force what information was collected by the panel whom they met with and how much the task force spent the white house provided the g a o with the financial records of the task force but administration officials have told the investigative body that they are not compelled to provide the names of outsiders who met with the task force the accounting office s general counsel anthony h gamboa said in a letter to mr cheney s office last week that the investigative body is entitled to more information the letter warned that if the white house does not provide the full range of information the g a o is seeking it may issue a demand letter a more formal request under the law the white house would have days to respond if the dispute continues the accounting office could bring a civil action against the administration love war and california electricity by susan lee the wall street journal page a copyright c dow jones company inc california s energy crisis presents at least a dozen major policy issues but perhaps the most complicated question and the one with the least satisfactory solution is who should pay for past power usage specifically who should pay wholesale electricity suppliers for juice that was consumed after wholesale prices rose fiercely above fixed retail prices between may and january before the state of california intervened a billion gap opened up between what the suppliers charged and the utilities could pay right now nobody is paying to be sure gov gray davis has issued a memorandum of understanding in which he suggests that ratepayers would bear part of the repayment burden in the form of a surcharge on their electricity bills and taxpayers would bear another part in helping fund the state s purchase of utilities transmission grids but the memorandum is just a vague promise and is already in deep political trouble it isn t fair to leave power suppliers hanging the power was used and must be paid for the problem is that just as in love and war the california energy mess no longer has a fair solution there are several groups of potential payers the no target group is consumers or ratepayers on the grounds that they used the power and thus should pay its market cost yet consumers demanded the amount of power they used based on its low retail price it s hardly fair to now go back and raise the price retroactively after all if the price had been higher consumers would have used less of it a second group of potential payers are the taxpayers on the grounds that this is a big political and regulatory problem for the entire state of california since most taxpayers are voters and since voters are ultimately responsible for the acts of officials they elect fairness dictates that taxpayers ought to suffer the punishment for the botched deregulation scheme but this solution too has flaws although sticking taxpayers with the bill might result in taxpayers to the extent they are voters throwing the political and regulatory bums out it doesn t locate the economic burden efficiently as distinct groups taxpayers and consumers may overlap but they aren t identical and then there is a third group the utilities themselves on the grounds that they shouldn t have been running around buying power they knew they couldn t afford although this may satiate a certain blood lust who doesn t loathe utilities utilities are regulated companies and operate under regulatory constraints and imperatives accordingly they bought power on behalf of ratepayers and they bought it like mad until they went bankrupt too it might be argued that shareholders have already paid shares of pacific gas electric and southern california edison have lost to of their value since the crisis began there is one other group of sitting ducks the suppliers on the grounds that they are in the words of gov davis pirates and marauders who profited from california s crisis but aside from basic questions of equity suppliers have already paid a price in the form of still mounting legal bills to defend themselves from charges of profiteering as well as in the lost opportunity to deploy the money owed to them moreover suppliers already can be expected to bear some of the payment burden since mr davis has indicated they will not be repaid dollar for dollar finally there is the group who is most at fault but the least likely to suffer the regulators and politicians on the grounds that they pretty much created the mess and they surely haven t moved to clean it up regulators most pointedly because they refused to let the utilities hedge their purchases of electricity when they pleaded to do so in politicians in particular the governor because they dithered for over a year preferring to blame the problem on someone else although putting this group out of work might be the most satisfying civic outcome the solution is a flop if financial restitution is the goal the latest most popular approach to solving the mess is to look at the transfer of wealth required in any case that would take place under each payment scenario this is what some of california s politicians mean when they complain that full restitution means transferring billion from the state of california to the evil out of state power suppliers but as irwin stelzer economist at the hudson institute points out there is a long history of wealth transfers to tote up initially when the botched deregulation plan was agreed to several years ago it involved a transfer of wealth from ratepayers to shareholders that is the utilities were concerned about making back their so called stranded costs mostly from overbudget nuclear power plants those stranded costs were to be paid by fixing or freezing rates at a level that would provide pay back to the utilities for their nuclear construction however when wholesale prices shot up a year ago the utilities and their shareholders were caught paying much more money for power than the rates they were allowed to charge and so the transfer of wealth reversed itself shareholders subsidized ratepayers now if mr davis s memorandum of understanding becomes operative the transfer of wealth changes again ratepayers will get socked by a surcharge on their electricity bills and taxpayers by the state s purchase of transmission lines taxpayers might also get hit if the bond issue goes off as planned in august and as expected erodes california s credit quality that erosion would mean that all state agencies that issue bonds would be required to pay higher interest rates in fact california s bond rating has already been downgraded by two major rating agencies simply put looking at the transfers of wealth doesn t yield a clear cut or fair solution to the payment problem either all this leaves politics to dictate the answer and the shape of it is already apparent suppliers ratepayers taxpayers and shareholders will bear the cost while the politicians and regulators evade the consequences in short the unfairness of love and war doesn t hold a candle to politics

lawmakers moved to drop contempt charges against enron corp on thursday after the energy marketer agreed to begin turning over thousands of pages of documents immediately the last minute wrangling between enron and a special senate committee investigating energy price manipulation essentially brought to an end a series of extraordinary legislative proceedings that were last invoked in following hours of closed door meetings enron signed an agreement in the early evening allowing it to dodge an impending contempt finding by the full senate and the possibility of stiff fines under the deal enron will begin sharing records with the committee in exchange for a confidentiality agreement intended to protect its most sensitive documents after they are turned over it took too long to bring this to resolution said state sen joe dunn d santa ana who chairs the committee i can t help but think it had to do with the pending sanctions for contempt as part of the deal however enron did not agree to drop the lawsuit it filed in july asking the court to intervene on its behalf said spokeswoman karen denne she said the company is still considering its options we re pleased they ve agreed to withdraw the contempt charges denne said enron and two other companies that managed to quickly purge the charges against them had been found in contempt in late june after it refused to turn over documents violating subpoenas that the committee issued on june the subpoenas called for documents of all kinds including those with specific details prices quantities and capacity of the companies transactions in the state s wholesale electricity market enron officials balked at the request saying they didn t want to turn over documents that might include confidential trade secrets ultimately the refusal to turn over documents brought the company perilously close to being found in contempt by the senate thursday morning the senate rules committee met to consider the committee s contempt

pro tem john burton sent the two sides into a conference room to work out their differences at p m enron officials signed the same confidentiality agreement that several other companies have signed

who chairs the senate committee investigating price gouging and possible collusion in the electricity market enron officials did not return calls seeking comment on the agreement late thursday the state senate today is also expected to consider a resolution that would order the nation s two largest public employee pension funds to sell off stock of any company that is found in contempt by the

sacramento enron corp agreed thursday to release company documents to a senate committee investigating possible price manipulation ending the committee s quest to cite the energy company for contempt for not complying with a subpoena the senate rules committee heard arguments from enron and the senate select committee to investigate price manipulation of the wholesale energy market over whether the energy company should be found in contempt in june the select committee subpoenaed enron files as part of its investigation into record high prices in the state s wholesale electricity market enron sued to quash the subpoena a motion a judge rejected the judge agreed however that enron was entitled to a protective order for documents revealing sensitive trading and financial information sen joe dunn d santa ana chairman of the select committee said late thursday that enron agreed to the same confidentiality agreement accepted by several other generators with that agreement dunn said the committee would withdraw a report that recommended enron be found in contempt he said he expects documents to be transferred immediately dunn had argued the subpoena also covered nonconfidential documents and since the energy company also refused to release those papers to the committee it was in contempt he asked sen john burton d san francisco chairman of the rules committee to approve fines against enron for each day they didn t comply with the subpoena the daily fines would start at doubling each day for days then the company would be fined million a day enron lawyer michael kirby said the company had put nonconfidential documents in a depository in sacramento so committee investigators could review them but dennis murphy a lawyer for the select committee said enron didn t tell investigators where the depository was located the committee discovered the address in documents filed by enron for the court case he said we ve been trying to get into the depository for a week they have not allowed our people in there to verify what documents are in there he said kirby disputed that and blamed the committee for delays in turning over the balance of the documents the two parties

still cautiously bullish there seems to be little incentive to abandon the bullish cause with the prospects of hot summer weather looming this is a weak market but i think that below you have to anticipate the return of industrial demand it s really a wild card as to whether that demand will take the edge off the current large injections over the past month the market has gone through a major change production has increased storage is higher and the injection last week at bcf was the largest since june of says george ellis broker analyst with bnp paribas new york i was skeptical of the whole concept of demand erosion but it s obviously real and when you combine that with an increase in production the supply demand balance becomes clear there is potentially more room to the downside but the wild card is weather and if that kicks in prices could move sharply higher if prices fell to then that would be a reason to put on another hedge as long as we re holding these prices i think there s a good chance prices will rally higher i m cautiously bullish i would not be an aggressive seller he said for a complimentary week gastrader subscription go to or call trenton blackriver boom

damn just got kicked off aol for the umpteenth time today tried to figure out this messenger business but only have aol messenger i think and after all the dissertation induced computer trauma this last moth installing it could prove to be the proverbial straw you know good to hear about chuck sr was worried about him when i heard about the missing planes am sure both chucks will be ok gals enron was spared as well but what an ordeal geez makes becoming a carpenter and living in nb look reaaaaaly attractive right about now city schmitty a beer out on the deck rt now would be super cathrtic i think i know y all aren t getting all the graphic footage there that we are here of the middle eastern countries parades and parties in the streets rt now so unreal and sickening how can people be that evil really sad you know michael loud london michael turns out he just flew back here from a meeting mon morning at the wtc and his entire us office of cantor fitzgerald was based on the top stories of the wtc no one has been heard from terrifying it s just so isolated and lonely here rt now want to be home so badly and i get so funky in these kinds of situations you know ultra sentimental and nostalgic and weepy and matt didn t help he did one of those i m so worried that our friends family don t know how loved and appreciated they are bits and that s one of those deep rooted fears that you just never want to deal with because we count on lisa to be the hallmark aspect of our grp and no one else i chalk it up to a frightening lack of estrogen amongst us all either way not something i want to start thinking about b c it s just opening pandora s box and can t stop still hoping to make it home on fri or sat and matt said he s going to houston on fri for a business thing so maybe we will all get to chill this weekend if the stars are alligned have fingers crossed ok bk to the bbc and cking on flight possiblities chat soon e from susan m scott enron com to ehillegeist hotmail com subject re date wed sep mine is sscott if you go to yahoo s home page you can try to install it yourself eek or use the search on your computer go to start search for files or folders and type in yahoo messenger if you still have it on your computer it will show up in the search area and you can just double click on it that should bring it up i m doing alright and you hit the nail on the head with the josh comment that s exactly what i ve been reminded of that feeling of uncertainty loss of youthful bravado sadness injured sense of security all of it everyone in the scott household is fine dad actually flew over ny yesterday morning before the first plane hit he was coming from manchester nh he said is was an absolutely beautiful day and that they flew right over central park no idea how dramatically that skyline would change the first they heard of the events that they must have just missed was when they landed in nashville he s still in nashville right now obviously but he s okay and that s what s important i m hoping with the limited flights they re allowing that dad will be able to make it back to houston soon but it appears the faa s just trying to get the passengers who are stranded back home so he may just be stuck somewhere else as a result chuck and chris were supposed to fly out tomorrow morning from seoul but they too have been delayed indefinitely the army has put a hold on all duty station transfers which means we have no idea when they ll be leaving korea or where exactly chuck will be going the stories and connections of the people on the news and those around me is horrifying and deeply saddening a large number of people we do business with are based in ny and have lost countless friends and colleagues in the wtc s destruction chuck has some pledge brother s who are working up there but we ve heard that both of them are okay i wish you were back home as well i was on the phone with my mom off and on all day yesterday and i must say it would ve been nice to been back home on the couch with her i did talk to jen yesterday worried about la and what was going on there but she was fine as well she said they d shut down the airport and several major roads surrounding it but nothing else of concern we evacuated the enron building around yesterday morning it was disconcerting i walked down the flights of stairs to get to my parking garage and had only one desire to get out of downtown there were rumors flying that houston was another target and given the size of our building our international presence esp in regards to oil natural gas and our ceo s connections to the president i think everyone figured enron would be a logical target fortunately those fears were unfounded on a lighter note i m very anxious to hear all about your marathon experience including the trip there sounds like it was a doozey love ya sue original message from emily hillegeist ehillegeist hotmail com enron mailto imceanotes emily hillegeist cehillegeist hotmail ecom e enron enron com sent wednesday september pm to sscott enron com subject where are you it s been ages since i heard from you are you ok you know it makes me nervous when you go awol matt called this morning and he sounds really bad is doing that oh so familiar over analyzing and internalizing that would make almost anyone suicidal considering the situation just want to be home so badly feel so isolated here wish we were all out on the walker s patio now chatting and i was with mom and dad and harls i think that s the only place where i d feel safe and reassured and as close to happy as i could be right now kind of like the way everyone described josh s funeral horrifying but as good a company to rebound with as you could find probably has been such a long and draining month emotionally and physically and am just gutted hope you re a bit more buoyant rt now han i am am trying to get home asap but mom and dad don t want me to fly am not worried about it and am going to try to get on first flight possible anyways so may see y all soon pls email and let me know you re still alive and in proportionally good spirits e get your free

generator destroyed working parts withheld power supply or otherwise took actions that they believe drove up the price of electricity state officials said the whistle blowers comments at a state senate hearing today could provide the most damaging illustration yet that power generators held down production to inflate prices on the spot market gov gray davis has long alleged that power companies have overcharged the state and utilities jimmy olkjer a former assistant control room operator at duke s south bay plant in san diego said in a phone interview that during the state s power shortages duke cut supply although duke a charlotte n c based company owned the plant and it contracted with sdg e to operate the unit he said rather than creating more power they were creating less olkjer said i think there was manipulation of the market the california public utilities commission and several state legislative committees continue to investigate price manipulation allegations and attorney general bill lockyer has said he will take witnesses to a grand jury next month the generators have denied they manipulated the market we stand behind our maintenance practices and have done a good job keeping the power flowing duke spokesman tom williams told the cbs television network but former mechanic glenn johnson said he saw generation units taken down for economics ed edwards also a mechanic said he was ordered to destroy pallets of working parts we were asked myself and other employees to disperse of perfectly good parts that were used to make repairs of systems and components edwards said state sen joe dunn d santa ana chairman of the market manipulation committee said his staff has been looking for employees or others with intimate knowledge of power plant operation to come forward and he promised that others will testify at future hearings it s the first time that we ve had evidence from directly within power plants in california that the ramping up and ramping down of power generation was a response to price and not to demand dunn said he said he would reach no conclusions until duke and other generators testify next month but he added that the former

published june when the temperature hit degrees at p m thursday larry lynch turned off the air conditioner unplugged the refrigerator pulled out the tv cords and shut down all other appliances in the house lynch a year old newsletter publisher in sacramento responded to the roll your own blackout thursday and joined thousands throughout the state to protest energy policies and promote conservation by stopping the use of energy from p m but the data coming off the grid at the california independent system operator didn t show the effort during the first hour of the voluntary shut off the demand for energy by pg e customers in northern california was almost the same as at the same time wednesday iso officials said protesters didn t expect significant changes on the grid i feel it will at least send a message that we don t have to depend on it energy said jackie bell a consultant at the capitol joining the conservation drive from her apartment on fulton avenue it s just a symbolic act said peter lopez of sacramento who decided to use the evening to meditate maybe i ll just go outside stare at the stars and try to spot a few constellations in the night it was the longest day of the year and one of the hottest but those determined to advocate conservation didn t mind the sacrifice people are getting focused on the fact that we have power at our end said joan blades a spokeswoman for moveon a grass roots organization in the bay area and one of hundreds of online groups passing along the call for the voluntary blackout an electrical engineer in oakland started the roll your own blackout idea when he posted a note in a political chat room in april then an artist in los angeles forwarded the e mail to a number of friends and from there it quickly spanned the globe by thursday afternoon more than people had signed up at the moveon web site to join the protest blades said many threw blackout parties in san francisco the nonprofit group global exchange gathered hundreds around a big bonfire at ocean beach at his home in east sacramento lynch did fine without electricity for three hours he ate tuna salad for dinner watered the lawn and when it got dark he opened the windows and let some air in we should show that people are willing to shut the power off if the prices go too high he said iso has not declared a power emergency since may we have seen a consistent conservation on a day to day basis and it s making the difference between blackouts and no blackouts iso spokeswoman stephanie mccorkle said mccorkle encouraged initiatives like roll your own blackout

turn up the heat on the governor for hiring the ex clinton aides by emily bazar bee capitol bureau published june two consultants hired to advise gov gray davis on energy policy officially disclosed their contract with southern california edison on thursday but davis aides insisted it is not a conflict because edison and the governor s office have the same goal communications consultants chris lehane and mark fabiani have drawn intense criticism since they were hired last month to shape the democratic governor s public response to the state energy crisis the former clinton administration communication aides nicknamed the masters of disaster for their spin on the whitewater travel office and fund raising controversies at the clinton white house have come under fire for receiving a six month a month contract more than the governor or anyone on his staff makes secretary of state bill jones a republican who is running for governor next year has called for an investigation into potential conflicts state controller kathleen connell a democrat has said she will not issue paychecks to the pair pending her own investigation the criticism mounted after the duo s economic interest disclosure forms were released late thursday showing that each has received at least under contract from edison in the past year but davis spokeswoman hilary mclean defended their credibility saying there s no conflict of interest because lehane and fabiani both disclosed that they had worked for edison before they signed their contracts with the state besides she added edison and the governor are working toward the same goal both want the legislature to adopt a memorandum of understanding a proposed agreement that would prevent edison from going bankrupt by financing a state purchase of the utility s transmission lines it s not a conflict because there s been full disclosure mclean said edison and the governor s office have the same goal passing the mou we re working together at this point with edison but open government groups and republican lawmakers bristled at the notion that disclosure negates any potential conflict derek cressman of the california public interest research group pointed to a section of state law that prohibits public officials from influencing decisions if it would have a material financial effect on a business entity that provided them or more within the last year you have two individuals on the government payroll who had previously been on the edison payroll and it s not clear to whom their loyalties are he said just because they ve revealed it doesn t mean there s not a conflict there and that they re not serving two masters on thursday jones said he is awaiting the results of the fair political practices commission investigation and agrees with connell s decision this week to withhold payment from the consultants this further calls into question the ethics of how these individuals were hired and contracts were let jones said senate republican leader jim brulte believes there s no question that lehane and fabiani are violating conflict of interest laws and suggested that the two should be paid out of davis campaign funds which had reached million by jan brulte of rancho cucamonga added that he would not vote for a state budget as long as lehane and fabiani remain on the state payroll the state of california does not need to be paying political wordsmiths a month he said i just wish davis were as frugal with the taxpayers money as he is with his campaign money the bee s emily bazar can be reached at or ebazar sacbee com state deal may ease blackout threat canada to supply energy as summer demand rises by ed mendel union tribune staff writer june sacramento california may be able to avoid some of the blackouts predicted for this summer thanks to a little known power swapping agreement with a canadian utility the arrangement is expected to give california electricity in july and august from the hydroelectric generators of bc hydro in british columbia despite a serious drought in the northwest california has sold surplus power in recent months to the government owned utility which is expected to return power to the state as heat drives up the demand for electricity state deal may ease blackout threat continuing coverage california s power crisis despite the energy crunch the state often finds itself with surplus power that can be sold or swapped for instance advance power purchases that provide energy at a better price may deliver more power than needed at any given time particularly during off peak hours bc hydro s reservoirs and hydroelectric generators are a little like an electricity storage battery by importing california power bc hydro has been able to conserve water that can be released this summer to produce power for california as a result of the agreement and other factors state power buyers say they are in a stronger position going into the hot summer months than they had expected so far this week the state has managed to get through a heat wave without so much as a stage power alert we are in much better shape at this point than i imagined we would have been as little as a month ago said ray hart head of the power purchasing unit in the state department of water resources the north american electric reliability council which last month predicted hours of rolling blackouts for california this summer has noticed a change in recent weeks we don t seem to have the crisis we were all expecting said ellen vancko a council spokeswoman but whether that is a short term or a long term event we don t think anyone knows yet much of the credit for avoiding blackouts is given to unexpectedly high conservation by californians and an increased supply of power many generators that had been shut down for maintenance or lack of payment are now back on line but the hydroelectric power agreement had gone unnoticed until now hart mentioned it during a senate energy committee hearing this week but he declined to reveal the amount of power banked with bc hydro saying it could hurt the state s competitive position in the market if i start talking specifics said hart then i have to give out what i am doing every single day and i have no market position in the past california routinely sent power to a number of utilities in the pacific northwest during the winter when residents there needed heat northwest utilities returned power to california in the summer when air conditioning drove up demand little was expected from the reciprocal arrangement this year because california was short of power last winter as electricity prices soared and drought has sharply lowered reservoirs in the northwest but the agreement with bc hydro will provide at least some power this summer the state was forced to begin buying power in january after its two largest utilities southern california edison and pacific gas and electric were unable to borrow because of a billion debt the rates that the utilities could charge their customers were frozen under a failed deregulation plan as the cost of power on the wholesale market skyrocketed hart said it took time to convince bc hydro which has demanded cash for some electricity that it could safely do business with california despite big debts owed to generators for power they supplied to the utilities we have only been able to do it for the last couple of months said hart it took a long time to get them to do it because of credit issues a spokesman for bc hydro said the utility engages in power swaps but does not release the name of the other parties or the terms of the agreements our first priority is taking care of our own said warren cousins of bc hydro we are still looking for opportunities to help out other entities when we can hart said the state has another arrangement with the federal bonneville power authority but again refused to provide details he said the state has sold surplus power to several buyers including the los angeles department of water and power information about state power purchases had been closely guarded until recently gov gray davis pressured by lawsuits and a court ruling released edited versions last week of long term power contracts worth billion the davis administration said it agreed to release contract information because power prices have dropped easing competitive pressures ex worker duke manipulated market by bill ainsworth union tribune staff writer june sacramento a former operator at duke energy s chula vista plant said he was told frequently by company officials during the past year to alter the plant s output in a way that may have boosted electricity prices the operator jimmy olkjer said he was even ordered to cut power generation during energy emergencies when the state faced rolling blackouts because of a scarce supply of electricity he said he believes reducing the electricity generation helped the company charge higher prices it looks like that s what they were doing olkjer said in an interview he and another former plant employee said that during the past year the company regularly operated its least efficient turbine possibly to justify higher prices the allegations which they plan to repeat today at a state senate hearing investigating power generators provide the first insider evidence that duke energy may have manipulated output at its south bay plant to drive up prices duke based in north carolina leases the south bay plant from the san diego unified port district a march report by the independent system operator which manages california s electricity grid alleged that by withholding power duke and four other owners of generating plants have contributed to billions of dollars in overcharges to california consumers tom williams spokesman for duke energy north america said that varying the output of the generating units at the chula vista plant had nothing to do with trying to achieve higher prices he said the changes in output helped balance the state s grid by dancing in the market providing flexibility for grid managers by allowing the plant to add or reduce power quickly williams added that the aging south bay plant produced as many megawatts last year as it did in olkjer served as a plant operator for years mostly when the plant was owned by san diego gas electric co after duke took over the plant workers were guaranteed their jobs for two years in april when that period ended duke laid off olkjer and other workers now he is retired during the two years duke has managed the plant olkjer said operators frequently got calls from officials with duke energy trading and marketing in salt lake city telling them to adjust their production schedule some employees at the plant monitored the hourly price of electricity posted by the independent system operator and recognized a correlation he said we noticed that a lot of times when the price was down our megawatts would go down he said if the price was up often the megawatts would go up olkjer said he was never told why he was being ordered to turn the plant s output up and down when he asked he said company officials told him it was none of his business still he was puzzled particularly when he was told to throttle down the plant during electricity emergency alerts as he says he did jan when the state declared a stage alert with the possibility of rolling blackouts it doesn t make sense to cycle up and down when there s a stage alert he said duke spokesman williams said the company may turn down units at the orders of the iso during a stage alert because the grid manager can find cheaper power somewhere else lisa szot spokeswoman at the iso said she couldn t determine whether the iso had ordered duke to power down its chula vista plant jan olkjer said the frequent adjustments of power production which sometimes occurred every half hour wear out the plant s equipment it s harder on the machinery he said it s like driving down the street putting your foot on the gas and then slamming on the brake before deregulation olkjer said the four units at chula vista which have the capacity to produce megawatts had been operated steadily during much of their history s david freeman formerly general manager of los angeles department of water and power and now chief energy adviser to gov gray davis said rapid cycling had become more common under deregulation and is hard on equipment we had almost megawatts of generating capacity down for repair last winter said freeman referring to what industry experts agreed was an extraordinary level of plant outages over several months sdg e which built the chula vista plant in the s sold it to the port district for million in the port leased the plant to duke energy for years in what critics are now calling a sweetheart deal the company pays minimal rent but has made large profits in the first quarter of this year duke which owns three other plants in california said profits rose percent to million from energy sales and trading duke may hold the record for charging the highest price for electricity it asked per megawatt hour this year by comparison before the energy crisis began electricity sold for around per megawatt hour an amount which powers about homes federal regulators have ordered the company to refund million to the state for charging excessive prices unless the company can justify them in may the company offered to pay the state to settle any price gouging investigations but gov gray davis declined olkjer and ed edwards jr who worked at the plant for years before being laid off in april said they couldn t understand why duke ran the inefficient high cost turbine unit during the past year while other generators sat idle they said they believed it may have been an attempt to fetch a higher price for electricity because the company got extra fees when it ran williams the duke spokesman said the opposite was true he said duke ran the small turbine more frequently because it was less expensive it ran on jet fuel which was cheaper than the natural gas powering the other units edwards said the smaller unit was run so hard that it was destroyed it ran so frequently and so hard it needed extensive repairs he said edwards told cbs news last night that plant outages at chula vista were prolonged because one supervisor ordered him to dump spare parts the former power plant employees said they felt compelled to come forward because they saw the impact the power crisis was having on their community it kind of irritated me because you know there s people on a fixed income that can t afford a big utility bill said olkjer staff writer craig d rose contributed to this story estimates of power profits disputed electricity a study of overcharges by suppliers may be flawed state officials say davis quoted the figures to congress by doug smith robert j lopez and rich connell times staff writers gov gray davis contention that california has been nicked for billions of dollars in inflated electricity costs is based on a study that state officials concede may have significant flaws according to interviews and confidential government documents those costs estimated by the state to be as high as billion were central to davis testimony this week before a u s senate committee where he again denounced power wholesalers and urged federal regulators to give us back the money that was wrongly taken from us the governor s impassioned demand however was based on shaky calculations the formulas are being reworked said charles robinson vice president of california s grid operator which prepared the study robinson said he had no idea how much the amount allegedly overcharged by the generators might change for now he said the agency stands by the numbers but internal documents from the california independent system operator warn that some of the financial assumptions used to quantify the alleged excess profits could be well off the mark what s more the documents caution against relying on the agency s study as a basis for allegations of overcharging as davis did during his testimony wednesday that warning was particularly important because the documents provide for the first time a detailed accounting of how much each energy supplier prospered from the state s power troubles between last summer and february the largest amounts were charged by four out of state power companies according to the confidential cal iso report okalhoma based williams cos led the group with million followed by duke energy with million southern company energy marketing now mirant with million and reliant energy services with million when told of the alleged profiteering attributed to them executives of the companies insisted the numbers were grossly overstated because of cal iso s poor methodology duke spokesman tom williams said his company s entire energy earnings for north america were less than the amount it was accused of reaping unfairly in california it doesn t add up it doesn t come close to adding up williams said what cal iso has done is highly irresponsible math paula hall collins a williams cos spokeswoman said the firm would need to study the iso report further but generally she said such reports fail to fully account for electricity production costs we maintain that we have not overcharged and that we have operated legally reliant spokesman richard wheatley also questioned the figures saying there s a lot of misinformation out of there a mirant spokesman said we haven t overcharged we haven t manipulated we haven t withheld even some firms alleged to have overcharged to a much lesser degree were outraged joe ronan vice president for government and regulatory relations at calpine said the million attributed to his company doesn t bear any relation to reality anybody can throw out any number he said it s like mccarthyism where is the evidence a spokeswoman for davis conceded that his refund figure was an estimate but defended it as reasonable it s no surprise that the people that are gouging us want to dispute an estimate of how much they re gouging us senior advisor nancy mcfadden said despite the cautions expressed in the cal iso documents officials thursday insisted they were not troubled that the governor referred to the agency s figures as potential overcharges the way it should be characterized is the amount paid above a competitive benchmark said robinson who is also cal iso s general counsel the first version of the now disputed cal iso study was made public in march it estimated that power sellers earned billion in excess profits between may and last february the report later revised upward to billion became a crucial element of the davis administration s campaign against alleged electricity price gougers this week just before davis appearance in congress the study was updated again adding another billions in alleged excess profits through may the orginal study which did not include actual pricing data was mostly intended to prod federal regulators into seeking information from generators that the state had been denied robinson said thus far the federal energy regulatory commission has ordered refunds of only million next week ferc is convening an unusual settlement conference aimed at addressing the outstanding claims by the state as well as those of sellers who claim they are owed hundreds of millions of dollars by california utilities one encouraging signal for state officials came this week when ferc reiterated an earlier order that duke energy pay millions in refunds the order stemmed from the company s sale of electricity at a megawatt hour for thousands of hours ferc s order said duke s pricing had resulted in million in billings a fair price for that power would have been per megawatt hour the agency said tom williams a duke spokesman said the firm is willing to accept the lower price he said he company has yet to collect a dime times staff writers elizabeth shogren and dan morain contributed to this story edison

investors what analysts are calling an unprecedented interest rate for billion in notes to refinance debt even so it s far from certain that the rosemead based power company will find enough buyers to complete the deal a failure by edison to refinance million in bank debt that comes due june and an additional million in notes due in july could put the company precariously close to bankruptcy and cast a shadow on california s plan to sell billion in bonds to pay for power purchases said dan scotto a bond analyst at pnb paribas in new york even though it would at first appear to be a company setback it would really be a major setback for the state said scotto who added that edison s credit troubles could translate into higher prices for california s proposed bond offering edison however said thursday that the deal is moving forward we believe our deal is going well and we are comfortable with it said jo ann goddard vice president for investor relations she declined to discuss other details of the offering goldman sachs group edison s investment bank expects to formally price the offering monday edison officials would not comment on the proposed price of the note offering but wall street sources said the power company was shopping the issue at the rate edison floated the plan earlier this month as a way to tap the borrowing power of a profitable subsidiary to trim debt that comes due this year and to insulate itself from a possible bankruptcy of its ailing utility unit the utility southern california edison has lost billions of dollars on electricity sales over the last year the high interest rate on edison s proposed sale of seven year notes is about double what a credit worthy company would pay for a similar bond or note issue and would add a premium amounting to tens of millions of dollars in annual interest costs to the company s already strapped financial condition analysts said it s a full two percentage points higher than the average rate for other junk or speculative bonds and corporate bonds with similar ratings are going out at to edison originally started marketing the issue at a full two percentage points higher than what analysts initially expected but then raised the rate to in recent days because it was finding few takers on wall street the word is that they couldn t get people interested and that they might not be able to get it done said kurt stabel a money manager at street asset management in newport beach the higher rate however might be pulling investors out of the woodwork and has increased the chance that edison will pull off the deal scotto said this never promised to be a day at the beach scotto said i think it is really a question of find the right price the price at which people feel comfortable with the risk both stabel and scotto said that edison s note offering is unusually complicated and requires far more explaining or selling than typical corporate offerings mission energy holding co a company created by edison for the sole purpose of issuing these bonds will offer the notes the assets of edison mission energy a subsidiary that owns a network of power plants across the united states and in asia australia and new zealand will secure the debt mission energy holding plans to issue the proceeds to edison in the form of dividends giving the parent company funds to pay off a substantial portion of its debt the notes will have a credit rating of bb minus and come due in according to bond rating agency standard poor s that s slightly higher than the near default cc rating now carried by edison if the offering failed edison would face a series of difficult choices that range from depleting its cash cushion to going back to its bankers and begging for continued forbearance its sce subsidiary already has defaulted on million in bonds and notes that triggered a default in bank lines of credit at edison international and sce which has since operated under extensions from its lenders edison has about billion in cash including billion held by sce according to regulatory documents this could all still unravel but i have been impressed with edison s effort to inch along so far said ellen

plans for baldwin hills plant power homeowners and environmentalists rejoice at decision the site is proposed as a acre state park by joe mozingo times staff writer in a victory for environmentalists and nearby homeowners an energy company announced thursday that it was abandoning its plan to build a power plant on the site of a proposed state park in the baldwin hills la jolla energy development inc in a letter to the state energy commission said it was withdrawing its application for fast track approval of the megawatt plant and will not pursue the baldwin facility in the future we listened to the community la jolla president steve wilburn said in an interview thursday we need to find another place for this equipment the project was to be a joint venture between la jolla and stocker resources an oil company that leases the land where the trailer sized natural gas plant would sit stocker officials said they will decide in the next few days whether they will pursue the project at this point it s just la jolla pulling out stocker spokesman steve rusch said but most observers said it would be difficult to move forward on the fast track schedule the state has implemented to relieve the energy crisis the state commission was scheduled to decide whether to approve the project today in sacramento but the hearing has been canceled the news sparked elation among environmentalists and nearby homeowners who had fought the proposal on grounds that it would pollute neighborhoods and threaten an ambitious plan to piece together acres of public open space in the hills we re getting ready to have the biggest party said tony nicholas president of the hills united homeowners assn this shows how a community can come together for a common goal and mobilize the people in a matter of days about of the residents in the hills are african american and many saw the issue as a matter of environmental justice in addition stocker and la jolla were seeking approval for the plant within days of filing their application under the governor s emergency power orders by following this fast tracked procedure they would have been able to avoid the normal time consuming environmental review process that angered opponents even further and nearly people showed up at a public hearing monday to fight the project but what officials said turned the tide against the project at a time when the energy commission is approving such plants as fast as possible was testimony from a south coast air quality management official who said his agency would not be able to approve the plant quickly executive director barry wallerstein said his agency would have to conduct hearings that would take up to days pushing construction well beyond a sept deadline set by the governor for fast track projects he also said it was unlikely stocker could get needed exemptions from federal clean air laws in a letter to the energy commission this week wallerstein wrote it appears that the baldwin energy facility could not begin operation until some time in the first part of at the earliest by wednesday night the energy commissioner who presided over the public hearings issued a statement recommending that the rest of the commission deny the application for a plant citing wallerstein s concerns conservationists embraced the outcome as a sign that the movement to create a park was gaining steam the baldwin hills conservancy was created last year with the idea of creating green space for the densely populated neighborhoods of south los angeles with support from the governor and local politicians the state recently bought a acre parcel in the area for an unprecedented million this is a great day for the baldwin hills and all the people who have worked so hard to bring this world class vision to reality said esther feldman president of community conservancy international and the main organizer to build the park also applauding la jolla s decision were state sen kevin murray d culver city and assemblyman herb wesson d culver city who had come out strongly against the project they and others questioned whether the small amount of power provided by the facility coming online after the dog days of summer would do much to relieve the energy crisis i m ecstatic wesson said at this point the environment has won the plant would have sat on what is a working oil field about feet from the kenneth hahn state recreation area and according to park proponents it would lie in the middle of the grander state conservancy on what would be a half mile bridge of land arching over la cienega boulevard rusch the spokesman for stocker said much of the information circulating about the trailer sized plant is false the plan did not call for a stack with billowing smoke he said if the issue is air quality we ve cleaned air quality up in the last decade rusch said the company s existing oil pumps on the property have reduced nitrogen oxide emissions from tons to tons a year the power plant with two foot stacks would ultimately add about tons a year he said the company was trying to cut its energy bills by providing its own power to pump oil while also contributing an extra megawatts to the state grid during the energy crisis residents say there are more desolate places for the state to relieve the energy problem said mary ann green president of the blair hills

need electricity to heat furnaces through the winter would be unable to outbid each other above the price cap which is usually determined by a formula based on the highest bid for last minute power during the most recent energy supply emergency in california that may leave power wholesalers and not a free market to decide who gets the energy certainly california has a tremendous pull on our prices and has for probably the last year said claudia rapkoch spokeswoman for montana power co which supplies natural gas and electricity to two thirds of the big sky state what it means for this winter we re just going to have to wait and see california utilities had much more control over power supplies before deregulation in obligated them to sell off their power plants to encourage competition this brought lower prices for a time but gave control over power supplies to wholesalers that aren t obligated by state law to serve the serve the best interests of local customers rather than appointing one power grid manager to decide how to divide power in the west ackerman predicts utilities in non deregulated states will simply sell their power within their borders that would hurt california which this week imported about percent of its electricity and its remaining supply from local plants owned by out of state power companies price cap or not utilities in the region will watch out for each other as best they can because they might need the favor returned said charles reinhold executive consultant for electric resources strategies in ariz saddled with rising bills that

christian berthelsen chronicle staff writer friday june san francisco chronicle url n dtl type news federal regulators have rejected attempts by duke energy inc to avoid refunding millions of dollars to california for charging exorbitant electricity prices in january and february the federal energy regulatory commission first ordered the refunds on march and duke responded by filing a challenge but the commission on monday rejected the company s appeal and reiterated its earlier order claiming duke had abused its power in the california energy market when it sold power for per megawatt hour we will not tolerate abuse of market power or anticompetitive bidding or behavior the commission said duke acknowledged this month that it had charged per megawatt for about megawatt hours sold to the state s major utilities in january and february netting it more than million in receivables the commission did not specify how much money duke should refund but it directed the company to readjust its january billings for those hours to a price of from a ferc document it appears that about hours occurred in january which would result in a total refund for that month of million duke is one of the companies that have been identified by both the california independent system operator the manager of the state s electricity grid and the ferc as having exercised market power and overcharged californians for electricity meanwhile employees at the south bay power plant in san diego run by duke are expected to testify in a state senate committee hearing today that the company ramped production up and down that allegedly was aimed at lowering power production during shortages and attempting to drive up electricity prices on the spot market the workers were employed by san diego

blue jacket and endured beastly humid degree heat this week in an area behind the capitol known as the house swamp the nation was watching and after months of political free fall his message seemed to be taking hold california has been bilked out of billion while the federal energy regulatory commission was asleep at the switch davis declared repeating testimony he had delivered hours earlier in the air conditioned confines of a senate hearing room wiping a bead of sweat from his brow as television cameras and two dozen reporters recorded the scene the california governor apparently couldn t resist taking another shot for nearly a year i ve been pounding on this commission to enforce the law the state s energy crisis with its volatile spot markets out of state generators and dearth of alternative energy providers is a dizzyingly complex policy puzzle the politics are much simpler democrats present themselves as consumer crusaders defending helpless utility customers from greedy energy conglomerates and misguided regulators republicans portray themselves as stewards of the free market and long term solutions rejecting price caps and refunds as heavy handed overreactions with soviet style results the democratic populism seems to be winning the battle though the debate is far from settled the consumer oriented approach to california s energy woes has raised their hopes of winning back the house of representatives in and the white house in republicans are scared out of their minds about this said one gleeful democrat on capitol hill who suggested that the white house s lackadaisical response to california s problems would rile consumers from coast to coast this could rival pete wilson s alienation of latinos said the democrat referring to the former republican governor s strident stand against illegal immigrants which many blame for the party s weak standing in california a sign of the gop s concern surfaced this week with television ads financed by anonymous sources but produced by republican party strategists that blame the democratic governor for california s energy problems democrats who long have worried that the crisis could cost davis a second term now take credit for having pressured the white house and federal regulators to take a more active role the federal energy regulatory commission which had previously resisted such efforts took steps toward controlling wholesale electricity prices monday later in the week two commissioners appointed by president bush testified that they might be open to further price restrictions and support huge refunds to california and just yesterday vice president dick cheney who has been among california s most vocal critics told senate democrats behind closed doors that he could support refunds to california if federal regulators agreed according to those in the meeting there is no doubt in my mind that action taken by federal regulators was the direct result of pressure for price relief led primarily by the california delegation davis said the pressure did not come only from democrats republican lawmakers some of whom fear the crisis could cost them seats in wrote ferc last week requesting commissioners to take further actions to help the state the democrats public relations success follows an effort by the party to raise the profile of its consumer crusade hardly a day has passed in the past several weeks without a group of democrats holding a news conference to attack the white house the republican controlled house or ferc for inaction but it may have just as much to do with a white house that has been far more focused on long term energy production than the immediate concerns of californians even as it engaged in a legitimate policy dispute over how to solve the power mess the bush administration appeared indifferent to the plight of residents experiencing skyrocketing energy bills and rolling blackouts bush tried to correct that impression with a trip to the state last month but the damage appears to have extended beyond california a cbs news new york times poll released this week of adults from across the country showed that only one in three voters approved of the job bush was doing on energy more than half the respondents said that protecting the environment was a higher priority than producing energy yet barely one in said that bush shared that priority some republicans say that bush was in a no win position contending that anything he did would have been attacked by california s opportunistic governor politics is davis main objective and i don t see the bush administration being that way said rep george radanovich r fresno the question for some analysts is whether democrats might have been too successful by pressuring the federal government to take a more active role democrats may lose their ability to point the finger at a convenient scapegoat davis has always needed rate caps much less than he needed a scapegoat now that

friday june san francisco chronicle url n dtl type news as state legislators consider gov gray davis deal to buy part of the power grid in california a public records advocacy group filed a lawsuit yesterday demanding that the state release a report on potential health hazards of living near high voltage transmission lines the document could be vital to how legislators vote on the billion deal to buy southern california edison s power lines said terry francke general counsel for the california first amendment coalition which filed the lawsuit in alameda county superior court the power line deal was brokered by the governor to help the cash strapped utility legislators must approve the power grid purchase by aug or the utility can back out davis also has a billion agreement to purchase san diego gas and electric s power grid which also would require the legislature s approval pacific gas and electric has not agreed to sell its transmission lines the power lines report was completed in april by california electric and magnetic fields program an agency set up by the state department of health services to study the issue francke said both state agencies and their directors are named in the lawsuit efforts to keep the report secret are suspect francke said if it s known there s some danger do you want the state owning that liability he asked the study began in after the state public utilities commission committed million for research and education on the subject francke said the state document deals with scientific findings on how magnetic and electric fields from transmission lines affect humans and possible policies based on those findings he said the report was scheduled to be released to the public on may but at the last minute the public utilities commission apparently instructed the staff of the emf program to keep the reports secret the lawsuit said state health services spokeswoman lea brooks said that the report was only a draft and that her department was following orders from the puc the puc wanted to see the draft before it is released she said we prepared the report for them we are following their request brooks refused comment on the lawsuit saying her office hadn t seen it puc officials were not available for comment studies on the effects of magnetic fields have resulted in no clear consensus on their effects francke said that s what makes the state study important for legislators to consider before voting on the governor s deal to buy transmission lines he said opponents of the power grid deals say the report may add to objections to davis agreements with the utilities some legislators would rather the state help build more power generators in california they are extra nails in the coffin said james fisfis spokesman for state assembly minority leader dave cox r fair oaks we have fundamental issues with the transmission lines but when you start stacking these items up you have an undigestible deal davis spokesman roger salazar said he believed the governor hadn t seen the health hazard report obviously if something pops up and is an issue you ll take a look at it but i don t think we re at that point

power baron enron finds fortunes fading christian berthelsen chronicle staff writer friday june san francisco chronicle url u dtl type news there s trouble in texas enron corp the houston power firm that s profited mightily during california s energy crisis is suffering a surprising lack of popularity on wall street while all eyes have been on enron s enormous profits here and its enormous pull in washington d c the reputed titan of the newly incarnated free wheeling power industry has lost half its market capitalization more than billion since its peak in august forgive californians for savoring a bit of schadenfreude over the houston boys reversal of fortunes but what gives isn t this the company that was fattening up on the backs of the state s beleaguered utilities residents and state budget isn t this the company with such close ties to the bush administration that kenneth lay enron s chairman was reported to have interviewed a candidate for a job on the commission that regulates his company yup that enron on monday enron shares hit a week low of after the federal energy regulatory commission decided to apply the same price controls to power marketers such as enron that had applied to power generating companies for months that s a far cry from august when the company s shares peaked at there s a whole kaleidoscope of issues that enron is being challenged with in the marketplace right now none of which on the surface is a major deal said donato j eassey an analyst with merrill lynch global securities in houston but when you combine them all i think what s happening here is you have a crescendo with this ferc announcement you have people saying ok the growth rate is now in question that growth rate was an eye popping percent in revenues for the united states on a two year average and nearly percent in the rest of the world enron officials did not respond to a request for interviews but as the stock continued to drop tuesday morning chief executive jeff skilling issued a statement to the markets in which he reiterated strong confidence in its earnings guidance the stock rebounded slightly throughout the week closing at yesterday in a speech at the commonwealth club last night skilling blamed regulatory interference with the free market for investor flight from his company our stock prices have gotten hammered he said they re half what they were a year ago tumbling stock prices weren t the only bad news for skilling last night a protester pelted the executive with a berry pie just before he began speaking as skilling used paper towels to wipe the pie from his face a woman was arrested on battery and malicious mischief charges enron isn t the only company with stock prices that soared in tandem with california s power crisis and are now suddenly headed south shares of reliant energy inc aes inc and williams companies inc which generate and sell electricity in california and el paso energy corp which sells natural gas here are all trading near week lows the main culprit appears to be the suddenly serious talk in washington about power price controls re regulation and now the possibility of big refunds being ordered for california even calpine corp of san jose which has developed a reputation as an industry good guy because it has not played the spot market and has not been accused of manipulative tactics dropped nearly percent yesterday to but none of the companies has been hit as hard as enron such a drastic drop in market capitalization poses serious problems for any company it leaves it less money to invest in its own growth and because executive compensation is so closely tied to stock price a sharp decline makes it more difficult to retain talented leaders while enron s power wholesaling division seems to be doing fine the firm has been buffeted by disappointments in other lines of business and other regions in recent months in the financial press the continuing knock on enron is that its business lines are so new and complex and the company is so secretive about its operations that analysts and fund managers don t feel confident in their understanding of what it does a look at the firm s recent troubles exemplifies its diversity for instance enron has engaged in repeated battles with the state government of maharashtra in india over a megawatt power plant there the dahbol power co which is percent controlled by enron stopped construction on a second phase of the project on sunday claiming it is owed million by the maharashtra state electricity board the state has accused enron of charging too much and not generating enough and stopped buying power from the plant last month closer to home enron has struggled with its investments in fiber optic bandwidth the company buys and sells unused high speed bandwidth space treating it like a commodity as it does electricity coal or natural gas but the fiber optic sector has imploded in recent weeks as it has become clear that for all the long distance cable laid in the ground there have not been enough last mile connections set up for users to actually take advantage of it earlier this year enron scuttled plans for a joint venture with blockbuster to offer what it called video on demand in which customers at home would be able to select a video of their choice for a fee and have it transmitted via fiber optic cables then there was the ferc ruling for months the agency had resisted aggressive price controls in the west preferring to let the market run its course but as control of the u s senate was handed to democrats this month and president bush appointed a tough texan regulator named patrick wood iii to the commission the agency changed its tune it expanded price controls to all hours of the day spread the controls throughout the western region and brought previously excluded power marketers under the tent so under current calculations that means enron could sell power for no more than per megawatt in a shortage and about during normal hours far short of the hundreds of dollars that companies were regularly charging during the past year in part the company s gyrating stock price reflects the volatile nature of the businesses enron has decided to pursue and the hard charging company has a reputation for going aggressively into entirely new markets but sometimes that approach gets it in trouble as was the case last year when enron had to take a million charge for its failed investment in azurix a global water company that set out to make a commodity out of water supply the same way it had done for electricity service as governments privatized their water systems the opportunities never materialized add it all together and enron has a tough time supporting a price earnings ratio of nearly considerably above the liberal standard of health which is the company had less than billion in profits on more than billion in revenues last year still a survey by thomson financial first call found that analysts expect enron to deliver earnings of cents per share in the second quarter up from cents last year and per share on the year most maintain a strong buy rating on the stock but investors with big positions in enron have taken a hit hardest put of them will be the janus funds which as enron s largest mutual fund investor held nearly billion of its stock as of the end of april in a semiannual report to investors john schreiber a portfolio manager said the stock price of the new age energy merchant was a victim of negative psychology resulting from the california energy crisis janus declined to make fund managers available for interviews there are tremendous rewards for being first into new markets said raymond niles an energy analyst with salomon smith barney in new york when you re an aggressive first mover from time to time you re going to make mistakes but i don t think any of the mistakes enron has made hit the core of the company e mail

shut down equipment in an effort to drive up the price of electricity former power plant workers said thursday speaking out on the eve of appearances at a state senate hearing the three men offered the strongest evidence yet that at least one power producer duke energy sought to make more money by creating an artificial shortage that may have created huge electricity price spikes their intent in my opinion was to boost the price up said glenn johnson a mechanic who worked for two decades at the chula vista power plant now run by duke if i ve got the only box of penicillin in town and you re sick i can charge a million dollars a box he said if you want to live you re going to have to pay officials at duke angrily challenged the accusations calling them irresponsible charges by disgruntled workers who were let go in april their allegations are just comical just highly erroneous said tom williams a spokesman for duke which runs four plants in california that produce enough energy for nearly million homes the charges come as the state heads into negotiations next week with generators over the billion the state claims its consumers have been overcharged duke based in charlotte n c came under considerable criticism when it disclosed that it charged the state a record a megawatt hour for power in january federal officials have called the charge unreasonable and ordered duke to refund california the money the employees who first made their allegations public on cbs evening news thursday night will be the only witnesses today at an energy crisis hearing headed by lawmakers who suspect that power companies have been illegally gouging california state sen joe dunn d garden grove chairman of a committee investigating price gouging said the allegations raise serious concerns while we still need to hear the other side of the story from duke if there s any truth to the information i believe it would be devastating to the generators he said perfectly good parts in interviews with the mercury news thursday night the three former plant workers said that they were directed to scale back energy production and throw out good spare parts that kept the plant from getting up to full power for weeks ed edwards who worked in the southern california plant said that he was told to get rid of many boxes of good spare parts edwards said he tossed more than pallets of parts into a dumpster i don t know why they were throwing away perfectly good parts he said it didn t make sense johnson said the lack of on site parts prevented workers from quickly fixing problems that reduced the amount of power the plant could produce sometimes he said it took weeks to get parts johnson s suspicions of gouging were echoed by jimmey olkjer who spent years in the plant and worked as an assistant control operator even at times when california regulators were warning residents the state might not be able to find enough energy to prevent imminent blackouts olkjer said he was directed to scale back the amount of electricity the plant was producing in hindsight it looks to me like they were manipulating the power olkjer said duke called the allegations baseless and said the workers didn t understand the reasons for the actions continued accusations repetitive investigations and inflammatory rhetoric concerning the company s operations in the state are distracting attention from the true issue of solving california s energy crisis duke said in a statement williams did not directly dispute the worker s allegations but he said they did not understand the reasons behind the decisions state directives duke cut back on the amount of power it was producing in response to directives from state regulators at the independent system operator which runs the power grid williams said they did not know that the iso was instructing them to go up and down to meet supply and demand he said an iso spokeswoman said that the grid manager sometimes asks generators to produce more or less power to adjust traffic on the transmission system or respond to the state s electricity needs some companies bid power into the reserve market which means these plants run only when the extra energy is tapped iso officials say they are prohibited from discussing individual bids as for the spare parts williams said they were eliminated as unnecessary after duke bought the plants from san diego gas electric williams said duke has one of the best performance records in the state with its power plants off line for unscheduled maintenance only about percent of the time all three workers were given severance packages and let go in april but edwards disputed any contention that they were trying to get back at duke i m not a disgruntled employee he said i m just telling the truth of what i saw the last two years i worked there no matter what the reasons were for the decisions duke has made huge profits during the california energy crisis and those profits apparently created good cheer among duke executives at one party johnson said executives gleefully celebrated their good fortune we re making more money than we ever thought possible johnson quoted the plant s

karen gaudette associated press writer san francisco ap california gov gray davis isn t to blame for california s power crisis and neither are electricity wholesalers a texas energy executive told a crowd at the commonwealth club of california jeffrey skilling ceo and president of houston based enron corp wiped away the remnants of a pie hurled by a protester thursday and placed the blame squarely on california s energy regulators the state public utilities commission in the early s put together a broken market by preventing utilities to pass along the full cost of power and discouraging power contracts that would have lowered dependence on buying last minute power skilling said because of these rules the power consumers of the state of california were thrown totally to the mercy of the spot market skilling said puc president loretta lynch defended the regulators actions last week saying utilities have been free to enter into long term contracts utilities countered that the puc never made clear what contracts it would accept which left open the possibility they would later be overruled i think consumers in california are angry and they should be skilling said prices in california shouldn t be as high as they are skilling also congratulated davis for california s unprecedented conservation denied accusations that enron chairman kenneth lay personally interviewed candidates for the federal energy regulatory commission which oversees interstate energy markets told the audience to expect a report that would show california municipal utilities have profited the most selling power to the state said price caps ordered by ferc earlier this week would likely damage the markets and would only exacerbate the problem acknowledged that municipal utilities in the state have managed to provide cheaper power to their customers and even profit from the power crisis by selling off extra power despite public control enron has come under fire after accusations from davis and state officials that it and other energy companies forced electricity prices skyward by holding back supply enron denies such claims and joins other power producers in arguing that the state and utilities still owe them billions in unpaid bills davis acknowledges that pacific gas electric co which has declared bankruptcy and southern california edison together still owe generators such as enron duke energy mirant and reliant energy about billion for past electricity sales our success is linked to efficient markets not higher prices in california or anywhere else skilling said protesters gathered outside the building wearing pig masks and carrying hand made signs one of which read greed is the only power crisis it s basically enron and the other companies raising prices said bernard greening a santa clara computer programmer who said he s unhappy with the record prices for electricity and natural gas pete snoek of tiburon said he believed what skilling had to say i believe the energy situation has been politicized so badly snoek said saying he was one of several in the audience to shush protesters during the meeting i hear the same people out there as if it s a sin to make any money in this country state officials counter that wholesalers charged as much as billion in illegal overcharges dating back to may companies have said california s claims are wildly exaggerated the federal energy regulatory commission has already estimated that wholesalers owe california million in overcharges for the first four months of the year davis and others say that s a mere drop in the bucket enron has also been tied to president bush s hands off approach to the energy crisis company chairman kenneth lay is a friend and one of the largest campaign contributors to bush and the gop several prominent members of the bush administration hold stock in the company enron is one of several major gop donors accused of meeting secretly with vice president dick cheney as he drafted the bush administration s energy plan enron is one of the world s leading electricity natural gas and communications companies with billion in revenues in it owns miles of

state senate committee today photo dave yoder the register three former duke energy workers say they were ordered to tamper with equipment at a san diego county power plant causing mechanical problems that helped drive up electricity prices during the state s energy crisis the workers say they will offer eyewitness testimony to a state senate committee today the first public accounts from power plant employees of how energy production may have been manipulated duke officials deny most of the allegations the whistle blowers mechanics ed edwards and glenn johnson and control room operator jimmy olkjer lost their jobs four months ago state sen joe dunn the santa ana democrat who is chairing the investigative committee on price fixing said his staff will attempt to verify the accounts from the whistle blowers but their mere presence in a capitol hearing room is expected to set off a media circus and if the accusations are true it could have wide ranging effects on the north carolina company s operations in california duke officials were working late into the night to prepare for the hearing and have scheduled a news conference later today they were doing all kinds of things that didn t make sense johnson said in an interview but if you asked them why to explain they told you to shut up and do your job the testimony comes on the heels of a federal energy regulatory commission ruling thursday ordering duke to refund million in overcharges for january this information lends credence to the concern that there was a deliberate strategy for outages for the sole purpose of impacting price dunn said what they are saying is disturbing duke energy spokesman tom williams said the fact that the former workers lost their jobs may be shaping their testimony the proof is in the pudding production is up and we ve had fewer forced outages since we ve taken over said williams but control room logs obtained by the orange county register show duke s trading arm ordered its south bay power plant in chula vista to reduce production minutes after stage three alerts were issued the logs are for january the same month that duke was accused of overcharging in california the three former duke workers each worked at the chula vista plant for more than two decades when it was owned by san diego gas electric they lost their jobs when duke assembled a new team to run the plant the three whistle blowers outlined their accusations in interviews with the register the accusations include the company ordered workers to throw unopened boxes of bolts steam seals valves and other parts into dumpsters the parts were needed to perform routine maintenance but were no longer available when repairs were required duke officials acknowledge that new parts were discarded but say the high inventory tax made it more efficient to order parts as needed because they could be delivered within hours edwards and johnson say they were ordered to dismantle critical equipment necessary for the generating units to run at full capacity because parts were thrown away they couldn t make repairs and generators ran at diminished capacity for days or weeks energy experts say this allegation if true would allow duke to withhold energy from the marketplace which could drive up the price duke officials counter that production has increased at its power plants and forced outages have decreased since they took over but in late there was a spike in outages at the chula vista plant according to records kept by the state s power grid operator the plant reported hours of outages from october through december there were relatively few outages before that the mechanics say the inability to perform repairs forced them to use a small expensive generator that was rarely powered up before duke took over the plant experts say that could have been used to exploit federal rules allowing generators to justify prices based on the costliest units online olkjer says he received orders from duke s trading arm to reduce production then when energy prices jumped he would get new instructions to power up again duke officials did not respond to olkjer s claim stanford professor frank wolak an expert in california s energy market said that if their testimony can be proven the state could be refunded millions of dollars and future energy prices could be dramatically reduced what they are saying is amazing this is a classic plot i ve always wondered how they kept the generators out for so long said wolak who heads an electricity market surveillance for the california agency that oversees the buying and selling of power they were very happy to have them off line because it allowed them to make more money wolak said the testimony seems to back up research conducted by the state independent system operator which runs most of the state s power grid and oversees the buying and selling of electricity in california in a report to federal regulators iso said that from may to november duke withheld electricity from the state s power grid percent of the time the report accused more than a dozen power plant companies of powering down generators to create scarcity in the marketplace that would in turn drive up prices in a separate report the state power grid operator accused duke of overcharging california again in january of this year resulting in the million refund order duke officials say charging a megawatt hour was justified during a short period of time federal regulators disagreed and said the power merchant should have charged no more than per megawatt hour williams duke s spokesman said that the company has been an ethical operator all but percent of the time we were operating that s very good said williams adding that when sdg e owned the plant forced outages took place percent of the time but dunn said that if the testimony from the whistle blowers is true and duke had the ability to manipulate prices federal regulators would be required under the federal power act to move them out of the competitive marketplace this would mean they would be moved back into a cost based market structure and would only be allowed to recover costs at a fair rate of return this would bring the prices down dramatically in california dunn said what generators fear most is being returned to cost based rate regulation allegations of market manipulation nearly a dozen investigations are under way to determine if energy producers illegally manipulated california s dysfunctional electricity market here are the main allegations was power deliberately withheld to boost prices several investigators including the public utilities commission the california attorney general and the federal energy regulatory commission are trying to determine if the largest generators and power marketers including duke reliant mirant and dynegy shut down power plants at key times federal environmental protection agency records showed times in december when tulsa based williams throttled back at midday letting williams boost profits at other plants it controlled including a huntington beach plant owned by aes corp were financial incentives offered to plant operators who shut down federal regulators have settled a case for million with williams among the allegations williams offered ffinancial incentives to aes if it would keep its plants offline williams has denied any wrongdoing did companies collude traders and producers were able to share information on web sites that helped them determine when to get the highest prices for electricity attorney general bill lockyer is investigating other allegations of collusion were workers ordered to fake outages three former duke employees will testify today that they were ordered to create malfunctions at a san diego county power plant allowing the company to command higher prices at other duke owned power plants duke denies this related stories ferc judge tackles task of

the odds that wagner will get a deal fifty fifty this is not the only high profile case that s taking up the chief s time these days he s presiding over a ferc inquiry into whether el paso energy corp a large natural gas pipeline owner is overcharging california wagner has a history of taking impossible cases angle says he recently worked with the judge on a dispute in the midwest that was a case where few people thought would be successful angle said it had been on ferc s docket for years wagner got the people talking and emerged with a settlement and monday won t be wagner s first effort at solving california s energy crisis last december he got the parties together to try to break the logjam over the long term contracting issue but just as he was getting a head of steam on that says wood the clinton administration yanked the deal away from wagner and tried to broker it themselves i know he s too much of a gentleman to say it but that was a missed opportunity now he ll be reuniting some of the same parties that were together six months ago because of wagner s longevity on the bench almost every lawyer or energy executive who is likely to be in the hearing monday will have had some dealings with him he ll be very clear he will not mince words said former ferc chairman james hoecker he will make his impatience with any dawdling very very obvious to everyone davis seeks billion refund the governor tells a senate panel that power operators bilked our state june by dena bunis and kate berry the orange county register washington gov gray davis told anyone here who would listen wednesday that overcharges from what he calls greedy power generators have now risen to billion billion more than earlier reported and he wants that money back the governor said if the meetings federal regulators have ordered next week to try and hammer out the differences between power companies utilities and the state do not end with that kind of money in california s pocket he ll be back they must be required to give us back our money davis told the senate government affairs committee during two hours of testimony and questioning it was the first time california s chief executive has testified on the state s crisis it is unconscionable that ferc looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to billion the billion is the amount california s independent system operator says generators overcharged utilities and the state from may to may of this year it had initially calculated that between may and february there were billion in overcharges davis said those figures are a far cry from the million that the federal energy regulatory commission says were overcharges that s because ferc only looked at three months of rates and only when the state was in an energy alert the governor faced tough pointed questioning from republican members and glowing praise and sympathy for his state s plight from democratic colleagues everything from refunds to long term contracts will be on the table at next week s settlement meeting ferc has given the parties until july to make a deal if they can t the administrative judge overseeing the talks will make a recommendation to ferc which can order the paybacks sen barbara boxer introduced a bill wednesday to require refunds if ferc doesn t act not surprisingly generators don t see the refund issue the governor s way it s just crazy said tom williams a spokesman at duke energy i don t know how they re coming up with these numbers and there s skepticism about next week s talks the negotiations are going to be like the salt treaty said gary ackerman president of the western power trading forum which represents power suppliers i question whether it can happen and work out also at issue is money generators say they are owed by the utilities davis said that s about billion but power companies say it s more like billion to billion whatever the figure davis said we want to see their money in our pockets before we talk about working anything out on their end the settlement conference was part of ferc s order instituting around the clock price caps for california and its western neighbors those price caps were made possible experts agree because california lawmakers from both sides of the aisle riled up the public enough over the issue that the bush administration felt the heat the question is whether that can work with refunds pressure could come from a number of places said charles cook a nonpartisan political analyst who has followed california s crisis it could come from republican members from the state from party donors in california who president george w bush is going to have to go back to and then maybe from his economic advisers who say that california can t be allowed to go belly up davis and sen dianne feinstein d calif said new ferc commissioner patrick wood a confidant of bush has been receptive to their refund pleas that was the case wednesday when wood expected to be named ferc chairman sometime this year told members of the senate panel that refunds may be an important tool in the regulatory toolbox if we re to be a vigilant market cop we need to make sure that our bite matches our bark wood and the other new commissioner nora mead brownell will meet with davis in sacramento on monday related story energy notebook energy notebook blackouts are still a hot prospect officials warn june by the associated press berkeley experts at the university of california energy institute say residents statewide should not be comforted by the fact that widespread blackouts have been avoided recently i would say this is not a great sign that we re going to skate by later this summer said severen borenstein a uc berkeley economist who heads the institute it doesn t look like the system right now can handle a blazing hot day if it s real hot in northern and southern california we re going to have blackouts greg fishman a spokesman for the california independent system operator which controls the state s electricity grid said iso preferred to look on the bright side does the fact that we re meeting electricity demand today mean we re out of the woods no but is the fact that we re meeting demand today good sure it is fishman said air conditioners are the single biggest factor in summer electricity demand if thermostats on air conditioners were turned to degrees across the state this problem would pretty much go away borenstein said davis plan to buy sdg e grid has fans and critics san diego gov gray davis plan for the state to buy san diego gas electric co s transmission system owned by parent company sempra energy is getting mixed reaction under the plan unveiled monday the state would buy the system for billion and a million debt owed to the utility by its customers would be forgiven it would seem that anything that in the short term lets the ratepayers off the hook particularly small businesses that can ill afford drastic balloon payments is a good thing said suzanne strassburger of escondido s downtown business association douglas heller a consumer advocate with the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights called the deal a cruel joke on the part of gov davis to say that he s burst the balloon payment because we re going to be paying for it we re applying that much to buy out sempra s transmission lines ge tries to enter state s transmission lines business sacramento through an alliance with a little known start up company general electric co is trying to enter california s transmission lines business although trans elect a year old company based in washington has no experience in the transmission business it has the financial support of ge s billion financial arm ge capital trans elect s latest offer comes as gov gray davis seeks legislative approval for his plan to buy the transmission lines of both san diego gas electric and southern california edison any involvement by ge in the state s transmission grid could be a conflict of interest said a lawmaker involved in the efforts to end california s power crisis you ve got someone with generation and transmission systems how do they keep them separate and do they said assemblyman fred keeley d boulder creek that s a concern for me would they have the ability to restrict competitors access to transmissions bob mitchell trans elect s vice president said the company made its offer believing that the legislature won t approve the deals to buy the two utilities lines ge joined forces with trans elect on march when ge capital services structured finances group inc announced it had bought a minority stake in the company neither company would reveal the size of the investment in other news a state board unanimously voted to reclaim its role in setting property taxes for electricity generators supporters say the board of equalization s decision could mean millions of dollars in higher taxes for electricity companies the eob will resume setting the assessed value of plants that produce at least megawatts of power and are owned by generating companies whose rates are not controlled by the state despite hot temperatures in much of the state blackouts were averted wednesday as power reserves remained above percent track the state s blackout warnings on the web at www caiso com systemstatus html in rolling blackouts together is all relative june i have a confession to make i m an n and as an n i can t help feeling a little guilty i feel guilty that i won t be called upon to share the pain of all those a s in irvine and laguna woods or the m s in costa mesa and cypress while the m s in fountain valley suffer and sweat through rolling blackouts i ll be sitting pretty because i m an n and the dirty little secret about rolling power blackouts is how many of us are out there allow me to explain as you may have heard southern california edison has been required to set up a public notification system for rolling blackouts if you hear on the news that the power guys are expecting rolling blackouts you can go to a web site www sce com or call a toll free phone number to see if your rotating outage group is on the list for going temporarily dark how do you know which group you re in on your edison power bill next to your account number there s a code that starts with a or m a a m m and so on that s your outage group number but wait there s another category of outage group if your power bill has the code number n on it it means that you re exempt from rolling blackouts you see under public utilities commission rules electric power customers who provide essential public health safety and security services such as fire and police stations hospitals jails and so on are automatically exempt from rolling blackouts even if they have emergency generators on site and because of the way electric power service is set up anybody who s on the same circuit with an essential service provider is also exempt from rolling blackouts for example my house shares a circuit with a fire station so i m an exempt n as are the other power customers on the same circuit but here s the kicker according to an edison spokesman percent of all edison customers are n s that is they share circuits with essential service providers and thus are currently exempt from rolling blackouts let me repeat that half of all edison customers are exempt from rolling blackouts for san diego gas electric customers it s percent mind you this isn t something edison likes to publicize when i asked about it for a column three months ago edison said it didn t know how many power customers are automatically exempt and when the company unveiled its blackout warning plan this week neither the edison press release nor news reports mentioned the percent exemption figure true even exempt power customers can be affected by rolling blackouts at work at the store at a traffic light still the next time you hear some power company or government official say we re all in this together don t believe it when it comes to rolling blackouts the truth is that only half of us are really all in this together and even an n can see that isn t fair,Phishing,Data Breach,0.5512134682505836,False

originally published thursday by jason leopold of dow jones newswires los angeles dow jones a california senate committee investigating manipulation in the state s wholesale power market approved a measure late thursday authorizing the committee to depose the chief executives of major energy companies to provide insight into the companies trading practices the senate select committee to investigate market manipulation voted in favor of deposing some of the energy sector s most powerful chief executives the move comes a day after the committee held reliant energy inc rei and enron corp ene in contempt for refusing to provide documents on its electricity trading and sales practices the full senate is expected to vote on the contempt charge and decide the punishment to impose sen joe dunn d santa ana the committee chair would have carte blanche to depose executives such as enron chairman ken lay who has been singled out by attorney general bill lockyer for gouging consumers in

wholesale electricity market to drive up prices and create artificial shortages it has yet to uncover a smoking gun but has secured the testimony of former duke energy duk power plant employees who

english news service c reuters limited milan july reuters montedison continued to battle a fiat led consortium s billion euro hostile takeover on friday but investors said its chances were fading montedison clung to the hope that an italian administrative court would rule in its favour against securities regulator consob which earlier this week gave the go ahead for the bid that court will issue a provisional ruling in the case on july the day before the italenergia consortium s offer is due to begin a judicial source told reuters montedison and its longtime backer mediobanca are also hoping that eu regulators will find that italenergia should have notified it about the bid and punish the would be predator by temporarily suspending its voting rights in montedison above all montedison is looking for an opening that would let it launch a counterbid for edison italy s second largest power company and italenergia s main target italian press reports today said u s power company enron could be interested in such a counterbid that was the latest in a series of potential white knights for edison that have so far not materialised the hope is to open a window that would allow them to launch a counter offer for edison said massimo aloi a fund manager at antonveneta abn amro in milan but the possibilities are low a suspension of the consob ruling would also mean a suspension of the so called passivity rule which bars takeover targets from taking evasive manoeuvres at this point we think the fiat offer should get a lot of shares tendered aloi added other investors agreed the chances were remote for mediobanca to hold onto its key industrial asset gathering support for a counterbid seems like an unlikely hypothesis because they would not be able to reach a majority of the capital at a shareholder meeting said luca comi head of research at eptasim in milan italenergia holds about percent of montedison ordinary shares the fiat bidding vehicle late on thursday moved to blunt criticism about the role of electricite de france cutting the french power giant s preference shares to a two percent weight italenergia had previously converted all but two percent of edf s ordinary shares into preference shares italenergia is doing its best to minimise the role of the french utility which has been accused of expanding into other energy markets while its home market remains mostly closed to competition in another potential setback to mediobanca the merchant bank could even be forced to backtrack on one of the anti takeover moves it took as italenergia
