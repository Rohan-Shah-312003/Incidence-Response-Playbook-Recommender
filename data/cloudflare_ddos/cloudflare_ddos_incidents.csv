We foresaw this sort of attack while mitigating the ""Netflix vulnerabilities"" in 2019, and added even stronger defenses in response toRapid Reset(CVE-2023-44487) in 2023. MadeYouReset and Rapid Reset are two conceptually similar attacks that exploit a fundamental feature withinthe HTTP/2 specification(RFC 9113): stream resets. In the HTTP/2 protocol, a client initiates a bidirectional stream that carries an HTTP request/response exchange, represented as frames sent between the client and server. Typically, HEADERS and DATA frames are used for a complete exchange.  Endpoints can use the RST_STREAM frame to prematurely terminate a stream, essentially cancelling operations and signalling that it won’t process any more request or response data. Furthermore, HTTP/2 requires that RST_STREAM is sent when there are protocol errors related to the stream. For example,section 6.1 of RFC 9113requires that when a DATA frame is received under the wrong circumstances, ""...the recipient MUST respond with a stream error (Section 5.4.2) of type STREAM_CLOSED"".",Denial of Service,Cloudflare Blog,https://blog.cloudflare.com/madeyoureset-an-http-2-vulnerability-thwarted-by-rapid-reset-mitigations/,MadeYouReset: An HTTP/2 vulnerability thwarted by Rapid Reset mitigations,
"The vulnerability exploited by both MadeYouReset and Rapid Reset lies in the potential for malicious actors to abuse this stream reset mechanism. By repeatedly causing stream resets, attackers can overwhelm a server's resources. While the server is attempting to process and respond to a multitude of requests, the rapid succession of resets forces it to expend computational effort on starting and then immediately discarding these operations. This can lead to resource exhaustion and impact the availability of the targeted server for legitimate users;as described previously, the main difference between the two attacks is that Rapid Reset exploits client-sent resets, while MadeYouReset exploits server-sent resets. It works by using a client to persuade a server into resetting streams via intentionally sending frames that trigger protocol violations, which in turn trigger stream errors.",Denial of Service,Cloudflare Blog,https://blog.cloudflare.com/madeyoureset-an-http-2-vulnerability-thwarted-by-rapid-reset-mitigations/,MadeYouReset: An HTTP/2 vulnerability thwarted by Rapid Reset mitigations,

CLDAP is connectionless, using UDP instead of TCP, making it faster but less reliable. Because it uses UDP, there’s no handshake requirement, which allows attackers to spoof the source IP address, thus allowing attackers to exploit it as a reflection vector. In these attacks, small queries are sent with a spoofed source IP address (the victim's IP), causing servers to send large responses to the victim, overwhelming it.

Even the largest, record-breaking, hyper-volumetric DDoS attacks can be very short, such as the 35-second attack seen in the examples above. 35 seconds, or even 10 minutes, is not a sufficient time for manual mitigation or activating an on-demand solution: by the time a security analyst receives the alert, and analyzes the attack, it’s already over. And while the attacks may be very short, the trickle effect of attack leads to network and applications failures that can take days to recover from — all whilst services are down or degraded.

The researchers found that a single client QUICInitial packettargeting a broadcast IP destination address could trigger a large response of initial packets.

"When using TCP and TLS there are two handshake interactions. First, is the TCP 3-way transport handshake. A client sends a SYN packet to a server, it responds with a SYN-ACK to the client, and the client responds with an ACK. This process validates the client IP address. Second, is the TLS security handshake. A client sends a ClientHello to a server, it carries out some cryptographic operations and responds with a ServerHello containing a server certificate. The client verifies the certificate, confirms the handshake and sends application traffic such as an HTTP request.",Denial of Service,Cloudflare Blog,https://blog.cloudflare.com/mitigating-broadcast-address-attack/,QUIC action: patching a broadcast address amplification vulnerability,
"The QUIC handshake does not require client IP address validation before starting the security handshake. This means there is a risk that an attacker could spoof a client IP and cause a server to do cryptographic work and send data to a target victim IP (aka areflection attack).RFC 9000is careful to describe the risks this poses and provides mechanisms to reduce them (for example, see Sections8and9.3.1). Until a client address is verified, a server employs an anti-amplification limit, sending a maximum of 3x as many bytes as it has received. Furthermore, a server can initiate address validation before engaging in the cryptographic handshake by responding with aRetry packet. The retry mechanism, however, adds an additional round-trip to the QUIC handshake sequence, negating some of its benefits compared to TCP. Real-world QUIC deployments use a range of strategies and heuristics to detect traffic loads and enable different mitigations.",Denial of Service,Cloudflare Blog,https://blog.cloudflare.com/mitigating-broadcast-address-attack/,QUIC action: patching a broadcast address amplification vulnerability,

"To combat the risk posed by broadcast addresses, by default most routers reject packets originating from outside their IP subnet which are targeted at the broadcast address of networks for which they are locally connected.

"The same techniques are not generally applied when a given router is not directly connected to a given subnet. So long as an address is not locally treated as a broadcast address,Border Gateway Protocol(BGP) or other routing protocols will continue to route traffic from external IPs toward the last IPv4 address in a subnet. Essentially, this means a “broadcast address” is only relevant within a local scope of routers and hosts connected together via Ethernet.

"Network bandwidth is the total amount of data per time that can be delivered to a server. You can think of bandwidth like a pipe to transport water. The amount of water we can deliver through a drinking straw is less than what we could deliver through a garden hose. If an attacker is able to push more garbage data into the pipe than it can deliver, then both the bad dataandthe good data will be discarded upstream, at the entrance to the pipe, and the DDoS is therefore successful.",Denial of Service,Cloudflare Blog,https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-auto-mitigated-world-record-3-8-tbps-ddos-attack/,How Cloudflare auto-mitigated world record 3.8 Tbps DDoS attack,

"If we think about what this means from the attackers point of view you realize there are similar constraints. Just as it takes CPU cycles to receive a packet, it also takes CPU cycles to create a packet. If, for example, the cost to send and receive a packet were equal, then the attacker would need an equal amount of CPU power to generate the attack as we would need to defend against it. In most cases this is not true — there is a cost asymmetry, as the attacker is able to generate packets using fewer CPU cycles than it takes to receive those packets.

"The first not-so-secret ingredient is that Cloudflare’s network is built onanycast. In brief, anycast allows a single IP address to be advertised by multiple machines around the world. A packet sent to that IP address will be served by the closest machine. This means when an attacker uses their distributed botnet to launch an attack, the attack will be received in a distributed manner across the Cloudflare network. An infected DVR in Dallas, Texas will send packets to a Cloudflare server in Dallas. An infected webcam in London will send packets to a Cloudflare server in London.",Denial of Service,Cloudflare Blog,https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-auto-mitigated-world-record-3-8-tbps-ddos-attack/,How Cloudflare auto-mitigated world record 3.8 Tbps DDoS attack,
"Our anycast network additionally allows Cloudflare to allocate compute and bandwidth resources closest to the regions that need them the most. Densely populated regions will generate larger amounts of legitimate traffic, and the data centers placed in those regions will have more bandwidth and CPU resources to meet those needs. Sparsely populated regions will naturally generate less legitimate traffic, so Cloudflare data centers in those regions can be sized appropriately. Since attack traffic is mainly coming from compromised devices, those devices will tend to be distributed in a manner that matches normal traffic flows sending the attack traffic proportionally to datacenters that can handle it. And similarly, within the datacenter, traffic is distributed across multiple machines.",Denial of Service,Cloudflare Blog,https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-auto-mitigated-world-record-3-8-tbps-ddos-attack/,How Cloudflare auto-mitigated world record 3.8 Tbps DDoS attack,
"Additionally, for high bandwidth attacks, Cloudflare’s network has another advantage. A large proportion of traffic on the Cloudflare network does not consume bandwidth in a symmetrical manner. For example, an HTTP request to get a webpage from a site behind Cloudflare will be a relatively small incoming packet, but produce a larger amount of outgoing traffic back to the client. This means that the Cloudflare network tends to egress far more legitimate traffic than we receive. However, the network links and bandwidth allocated are symmetrical, meaning there is an abundance of ingress bandwidth available to receive volumetric attack traffic.",Denial of Service,Cloudflare Blog,https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-auto-mitigated-world-record-3-8-tbps-ddos-attack/,How Cloudflare auto-mitigated world record 3.8 Tbps DDoS attack,

"Jenkins Flood is a DDoS attack that exploits vulnerabilities in theJenkins automation server, specifically through UDP multicast/broadcast and DNS multicast services. Attackers can send small, specially crafted requests to a publicly facing UDP port on Jenkins servers, causing them to respond with disproportionately large amounts of data. This can amplify the traffic volume significantly, overwhelming the target's network and leading to service disruption. Jenkins addressed this vulnerability (CVE-2020-2100) in 2020 by disabling these services by default in later versions. However, as we can see, even 4 years later, this vulnerability is still being abused in the wild to launch DDoS attacks.",Denial of Service,Cloudflare Blog,https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-threat-report-for-2024-q1/,DDoS threat report for 2024 Q1,

"An ACK-RST Flood exploits theTransmission Control Protocol (TCP)by sending numerous ACK and RST packets to the victim.

Because it uses UDP, there’s no handshake requirement which allows attackers to spoof the IP address thus allowing attackers to exploit it as a reflection vector. In these attacks, small queries are sent with a spoofed source IP address (the victim's IP), causing servers to send large responses to the victim, overwhelming it.

"Floods abusing the SPSS (Source Port Service Sweep) protocol is a network attack method that involves sending packets from numerous random or spoofed source ports to various destination ports on a targeted system or network. The aim of this attack is two-fold: first, to overwhelm the victim's processing capabilities, causing service disruptions or network outages, and second, it can be used to scan for open ports and identify vulnerable services.
